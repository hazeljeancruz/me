<p>Web development isn’t very complex, but it’s messy. There’s very many
technologies and it’s hard to find a thing that will work for you.</p>

compiler. And make <code>make</code>. And here you go - you’re development environment
is setup. Building 100KLOC application in C in Vim is absolutely doable.</p>
