I didn't really know what to expect out of this book, but in general my
understanding is it's a directed way for generating common voice and
opinions on particular case/problem.

You lead the meeting between multiple people in a directed way (which
actually can be called "blue hat") and have people talk about the same case
from different perspective.

De Bono gave an example of a group of people looking at the big,
square-shaped house. Looking together at the same wall from the same
perspective can lead to much better perception of the building. Often it can
lead to agreements on what we see, and how we perceive certain walls. This
is as opposed to having uncoordinated effort of seeing things: people alone
walking around the building for 10 minutes and meeting later to discuss what
they saw.

So leading the group is basically about management of hats: you explicitly
request from a group to consider the case from certain perspective (hats)

Hats are:

+ white -- cold facts
+ red -- feelings
+ black -- negation; critical view
+ yellow -- acceptance: positive view
+ green -- creative view; lateral thinking
+ blue -- conclusion (management of all previous hats)

Even though blue hat is presented as the last one, my understanding is that
this hat should be implicitly requested at the beginning of the session,
when the leader asks members to collect thoughts. De Bono points out order
of "hats" is arbitrary, and multiple successful applications are possible.

Next hats follow, and my understanding is that you're not really supposed to
question things said. You write them down, unless the category (hat) has
been wrongly identified, in which case certain options are postponed till
the hat gets switched to the right one.

White hat collects common knowledge on the problem. You mention and collect
stuff which is known to be true; which is the fact. There's no speculation,
no negation at this stage. If thinking was a math, this stage would be
called "Given data".

Red had represent feelings. Feeling aren't backed by anything. This is just
internal expression on the particular problem given by the member of the
group. There's no further questions asked.

Black hat represents negative view on things. It's protective
perspective--you point out bad features of the solution; disadvantages of
following certain path. You express what you feel isn't right and what is
suspicious or plain wrong.

Yellow hat is an opposite of the black hat. You point out good things about
given solution.

Green hat is the creative hat. You steer your mental effort toward creative
solutions in the hope of coming up with new ideas. There's no discussion on
this stage, and no criticism of ideas given. You simply write them down.


The whole method seems to be a directed brain-storming session, where
instead of random order of expressing opinions, the whole activity is
coordinated. This may lead to less frustration and more understanding what
is expected out of the individual members of the meetings, I believe.

Haven't tried that method as of yet. However the idea of thinking in 6
categories is appealing to me. I'm going to try to explore this concept by
myself first, maybe with writing down things to consider and will see how it
goes. Opinions on the method are welcome too.

Author cites some spectacular results in the industry world...
