Live recordings from countries other than Poland let me realize how
different the society is. It's very hard for me to believe such a class
would have taken place in Poland.

Some parts were nice, but some were a scam. The thing where Eker encouraged
people to go and lie in the stores to get free stuff was kind of low in my
opinion. It seemed almost like stealing form the store owners by stretching
their trust to you.

Valuable study as long as you'll judge all subjects presented.
