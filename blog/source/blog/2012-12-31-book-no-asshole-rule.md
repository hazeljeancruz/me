I scored 7/23 on "Are you an asshole" scale, which makes me be in a "You
have to watch yourself" category.

Based on the question in the questionare I think some more questions would
have to be added, to make this list not overly sensitive.

My company in the context of "Good companies to work for" is mentioned in
this book, among few other good examples.

Several examples or harassment are actually hard to believe, since most of
the American companies are "equal opportunity" places, meaning what e.g.:
using racial comments in an argument with another person is strictly
prohibited. Thus not sure why activities mentioned in this group sometimes
become routine for some individuals (on the other hand why do equal
opportunity employers hand you a "white/black/asian/indian" form at the
beginning of your contract?)

So instead of classifying people as "certified asshole" it should rather
classify it as "prohibited" behavior.

The thing which I must honestly say: some people are very resistant to being
polite. Basically: unless you stretch, stop on or just bypass the border of
good behavior, it'll be very hard to achieve anything.  Thus if trying
polite doesn't seem to work, you must try harder.

From the typical corporate life, probably I experienced one of the behaviors
explained. Only through e-mail, where my recipient started ignoring my
polite questions and requests, while I was still being CCed on his
communication with other people on my case. But that's rare.
