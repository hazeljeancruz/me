This book was similar to "22 lawy of marketing".

Positioning is what I'd say a strategy for creating a perception about your
product in customer's mind.

The need for positioning is backed by the huge number of new products coming
from all sorts of markets.

Getting into prospect's mind is heavily emphasized ("it's not a battle of
products, it's a battle of perceptions").

Interesting strategy of using a competitors position to reposition yourself
is explained ("We try harder" case). This is stuff that I never really paid
attention to.

Authors talk about product naming--something that lots of people seems to be
concerned about. Picking a good name is very crucial in terms of your
product prospectives. Trying to come up with names which are easy to
pronounce will be my motto since now on (however I really believe Apple
computer would be successful no matter if Apple II was called Apple II, or
Apple XR10Z).

Interesting thing here was to try to name products in a such a way, that the
heritage or its special roots/values are preserved. Don't pick fancy names
for simple products.

Shorting names considered bad. Just try to pick a good name upfront.

Line extension is when you have successful brand or product and you're
trying to use it's position to position yet another product in the market.
This seldom works.

I suggest you read this one..
