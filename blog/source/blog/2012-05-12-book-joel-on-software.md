### NOTES ###

U la la. Just read. Simply read and enjoy. I think this is number #1 in
terms of "what changed my approach to software engineering".

In order to write this review, I'd have to simply rewrite this book with my
own words, since pretty much everything there shows you real-world approach
on writing and selling your products, and not only.

MUST HAVE for everybody seriously thinking about making software.
