### NOTES ###

Not being Apple practitioner didn't stop me from reading about Apple and
Steve Jobs:

### Some conclusions.

**Consistent project vision and design** Have you ever read 
%%inc/mythicalmanmonth%%
?
I see an reverse analogy between S/360 and Apple -- having a leader with a
vision of a product line is important. It's sometimes interesting how really
big products can succeed when being designed by one person. The most I
impressed was by

which apparently was designed by a single person.

### Book

The book outlines lives of Apple and Steve Jobs. In some moments it's too
much of preaching of Jobs being #2 right after God, but in general it was
pleasant to read (factor price/content is very good for this book)

Summary of the book:

+ Start small
+ User experience 1st; then technology
+ Loosing is always good. I see an analogy between what Jobs had done and
