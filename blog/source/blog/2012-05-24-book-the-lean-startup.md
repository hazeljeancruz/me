### NOTES ###

Full title: "The Lean Startup -- How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous
Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses"

The thing is that IMVU's idea was one of the most ridiculous thing I've ever
heard. But it's only because I don't buy ideas with virtual reality. I'm a
retarded alien who just enjoys fresh air and nature. So ... I expected this
book will be about absolute failure.

And to some sense, it was. But not entirely.

After this lecture, I think I understand the lean business process more..

I hope you'll skip this book, so that I can be ahead.

DON'T READ THIS BOOK.
