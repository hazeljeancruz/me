Reading about good old days is something I enjoy in my free time.
Getting to know history of computer is something that compensates my general
lack of history knowledge, I believe.
Not only does the history help you prevent mistakes from the past, but it
also inspires to reuse some of the ideas of early giants.

"The Soul Of A New Machine" I found on 2010 on the shelfs of unowned books in my
company, but I didn't really have a motivation to read it back then. I saved
a title on my Amazon Wishlist.

I decided to get a copy of it in 2012 and read it. Very pleasant and
entertaining lecture.

The Eagle Project is an excellent history from the backstage, "kitchen" side
of view. We're talking about serious engineering here: CPU consisting
multiple PCBs and wire connections in between them.

Except actual design problems, guys had to solve lots of "loose PCB" issues,
as well as social problems related with high turnaround in the later months.

Very entertaining at the beginning, but I just couldn't finish it. Get
pretty boring by the end.

Nice historical study.
