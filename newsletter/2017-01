<p>Hello,</p>

<p>A while ago you subscribed to my mailing list. Maybe you liked one of the
articles I’ve written on <a href="http://www.koszek.com">my website</a>?  For 2017 I
plan to give you regular monthly updates to keep myself accountable. That’s
right–one e-mail a month. That’s all. But you don’t have this limit. You
can e-mail me more times, with questions and suggestions, and the most
important: your criticism.</p>

<p>This January I wrote four articles and I believe you may find them
interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/01/02/thats-why-you-havent-accomplished-enough-in-2016/">That’s why you haven’t accomplished enough in 2016</a>
has my ideas on goal settings and shows two books which helped me a lot
with productivity. To write my blog, for example, I’m trying to build a
habit of writing every day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/01/17/reading-for-software-engineers/">Reading 101 for software engineers</a>
gives you hints on how to filter good technical content. I don’t like new
books on software engineering, and I argue you should mostly focus on
long-lasting topics that don’t change much.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/01/18/the-best-osx-file-manager/">The best OSX file manager</a>
will be useful only if you have an Apple Mac computer. It talks about
muCommander–the tool which increased my productivity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/01/28/why-you-should-start-programming-on-unix/">Why you should start programming on UNIX</a>
explains why I believe that using UNIX (building block of OSX and Linux)
to start programming and I argue other domains of programming are harder
to get into.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to encourage you to subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/wkoszek">my YouTube
channel</a> I just started. It will be
about software and technical topics. The most relevant videos so far are:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6YDXyF6ks&amp;t=726s">Building an Open Source iOS app, part 1</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE49zGSFcio&amp;t=46s">Building an Open Source iOS app, part 2</a>.
This is one, very long talk, I know. I went over time. But the feedback was positive, and I
made new professional connections.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think and feel free to re-connect and let me know what
you’re up to.</p>

<p>Take care and see you in a month.</p>
