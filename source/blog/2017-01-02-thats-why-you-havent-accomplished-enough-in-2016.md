When you make a plan to accomplish goals, most of the time you don't do it
very well. Maybe it's the book you wanted to read, the podcasts you wanted
to listen, or maybe finally wrapping up the pet project of yours.

First of all typically you have too many goals.
Another problem is that they're not very precise.
Not very measurable.
You don't know how to even start. You never start and thus you fail.
Maybe even you're slightly depressed or upset, since not finishing what
you've plan kind of sucks.

I've been there and done that.

The best book I've ever read which helped me, and which will help you with
setting proper goals is this:

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1483393307&sr=8-1&keywords=getting+things+done&linkCode=li2&tag=wojcadamkoszh-20&linkId=36d41f0280a3efb64d38131870e170e2" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0143126563&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=wojcadamkoszh-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wojcadamkoszh-20&l=li2&o=1&a=0143126563" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I've listened to it over Audible, and I've also got myself a papercopy, I
liked it so much.

The idea behind getting things done is to create a list of things which
make sense in the context of what you want to achieve. If you develop a
software you probably know this, but if you don't, here's also one of the
hidden gems: remember about things which take time, but aren't immediately
obvious.

For example: if you want to learn how to bake a cake, you need to learn
about types of cakes, pick the one you like, maybe get the cooking book,
then shop for ingredients. Bring them back from the store and use them in
your kitchen. In the kitchen you may learn that you don't have proper cake
form and maybe you miss a baking paper etc. When you make your New Year
goals you must remember how to put all these things in your plan, so that
you can actually properly plan things.

David teaches that whatever takes a short time, you probably should already
do, but for New Year, it doesn't matter. You plan for things which will
happen months ahead.

Not to find yourself overwhelmed with new goals, I can recommend you a
second book which helped me greatly in my engineering practice. It's this
one:

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1483393761&sr=8-1&keywords=power+of+habit&linkCode=li2&tag=wojcadamkoszh-20&linkId=587fc3a13c969fb51482f21459f5a999" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=081298160X&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=wojcadamkoszh-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wojcadamkoszh-20&l=li2&o=1&a=081298160X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

So while David will teach you how to nicely partition your goal, this
Duhigg's book will teach you how to achieve them. It's basically the idea of
creating enough space in a day, let's say 15 minutes, in which you can do
the work. And do it every day or every week of every month.

This helped me with software engineering where I started to make the
commitment of making a small change to my program, every day. Regardless of
how small change, it still counts. Over 300 days making many small changes
makes it looked like you've made a huge change.

That works for New Year goals too.
