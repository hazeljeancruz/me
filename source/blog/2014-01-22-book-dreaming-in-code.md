The full title was: Dreaming in Code: Two Dozen Programmers, Three Years,
4,732 Bugs, and One Quest for Transcendent Software.


The book explains the story behind Chandler, Mitch Kapor's open-source pet
project in which he invested couple of millions of $$$ and it's failure.

I really expected something different from this book and I really can't tell
how I feel about it.

On one side, the structure of the book is fairly disruptive: its project
commentary part, largely documentary, is good and fairly well documented and
falls into the category of standard IT books reporting on project's
biography.

On the other side I think it's great for novice project managers, who got
pushed to manage technical projects: it explains basics operation of the
software team and gives some rudimentary knowledge on the nature of software
and software creation skill-set and tools.

Since most of technical stuff in the book happens to be familiar to me, I
found technical descriptions to make me loose focus and I had to backtrack
the audio track several times.

Depending on which audience group you're qualifying for, I'd decide whether
to give this book shot.
