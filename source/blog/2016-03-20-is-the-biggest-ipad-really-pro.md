When iPad Pro came out, I got excited. The price was fairly high, but this
model seemed to include all features I really always wanted from a tablet.

My tablet priorities:
- big, high resolution screen. I think it means no more eyeballing of
  A4/American Letter size documents on small screen with scaled down fonts,
  and also more trees saved on printing down things I'd only read once.
- pencil for drawing
- a lot of memory for podcasts, trainings and audiobooks
- ability to use 

iPad Pro is my first tablet ever. Up until this point I felt like buying a
tablet would be a total waste of money, since the features from the list are
pretty essential for my workflow.

When I also looked at the tablets in the recent years I had the feeling we 
are not getting is right, since most of the documents are in formatted as
if they were to be printed.

Yes, paper is still around, but it seems like we haven't yet
figured out that PDFs could in fact be formatted for a different screen
sizes to deliver something readable for the user.

Right now when I take a random PDF and open it on iPad Air  2, the 2nd
biggest tablet after Pro, the letters will most likely be small, and
everything will require swiping the screen and panning the documents around,
which makes me dizzy always.

## Buying iPad Pro

Depending on what you do 32GB model may be right for you, and to be honest,
the very first device I picked from the store was that big. Then I installed
couple of apps and recorded a session of me playing drums, and I realized
that I have 5GB of free storage. Mea culpa. I ended up upgrading 128GB
model. Thank you for a 14-day return policy, Corporate America.

My hands are too big even for an iPad Pro, thus I can't type on the screen
keyboard long-term. While in the store, together with my iPad I tried Apple
and Logitech cases. Both are case + keyboard combo, and they are both pretty
solid.

Logitech case was the one which I picked first and decided to give it a
shot. The deciding factor was a mechanical keys, similar to something you'd
find in a typical keyboard.

Logitech case pros:
- mechanical keyboard
- nicely wraps iPad from top to bottom.

My biggest cons:
- snapping to the magnetic connector didn't work too well. It seemed like
  the grip wasn't strong enough, so if you lie and want to slightly bend the
  keyboard and write on it, it just wasn't working.
- the whole case is plastic, and each time magnetic strip would get
  released, I felt like I was scratching the edge of the iPad. No visible
  damage to the edge has been
- there was no good way to fold it behind iPad. Looks like this case was
  designed for people who'd use iPad only with this case. For me keyboard is
  "nice to have", while reading on is probably my top choice. So I didn't
  like it.
- They placed a "lock" key just above "Delete", which I keep typing all the 
- it was very heavy.

And this is how I returned the Logitech case and I went with the Apple one.

Thank you for 14-day return policy, Corporate America.

# So how is the big iPad?

As always Apple delivered great hardware. The Apple Keyboard is difficult to
use at first, but after couple of hours of writing on it, I'm getting used
to it. In fact, this article was written on an iPad. 

I have yet to order a protection for the back of the iPad. Other
