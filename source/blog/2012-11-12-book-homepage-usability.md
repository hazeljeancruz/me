Dean of usability so impressed me with his
[http://www.useit.com/](http://www.useit.com), that I decided to read his
books. After I was happy with "Design of everyday things", I decided to
stick to his usability suggestions. I couldn't find any book about
application design, but since modern applications are likely to be done
through the browser anyway, I decided to stick to his books about web pages.

This book went through some designs and explained in a great detail, what is
done wrongly, and what could be improved.

In cases where discussed homepages got improved, authors showed corrected
version too.

I did some thinking about things which I design myself, so that I'm less
surprised seeing users using my tools for the first time.

You see, not being GUI programming guru, I use WWW to help me derive helpful
tools, since most often than not, HTML works just fine for presenting
content to multiple users with all sorts of different OS/browser platforms
quickly.

In the big corporations with IM clients (which have no history, due to
"security purposes" -- thanks got SHIFT+F12 works!) sending links to your
web pages/scripts is the best and fastest way to deliver what people want.

Useful lecture for all programmers and software engineers.
