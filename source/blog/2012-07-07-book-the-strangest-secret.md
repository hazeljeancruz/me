This is one of the most influential books that I recommend to people.
Earl Nightingale is probably right after Napoleon Hill on the success
preachings ladder.

I listened to this one and I admit it was a pleasant experience.

Probably the most effective and powerful content I've injected myself.

Interestingly, this content was broadcasted in the US radio in 60's. Being
an excellent speaker let him to deliver the content in a very attractive
form. Just like with Hill, falling asleep with Nightingale's speeches isn't
possible.

He's probably one of the best speakers I've ever listened to.

Can't learn old dog new tricks?
