title:	"Mental toughness training"
author: "Wojciech Adam Koszek"
abstract: >
  The only thing I remember from this book is how sports can be mentally
  challenging, since as you get closer to winning, you're more stressed out
  about loosing. And that's when the control comes into the play for people
  advanced in the art of sports. Interesting. I keep coming back to it when
  people make fun out of golf.

"Mental Toughness Training", just like its subtitle says, is a guide to
achieving ideal performance at will.

Ever wondered what top golf or training players feel when they're challenged
with a need of winning this last match? Or hitting the last ball?

This book gives good overview how people train themselves to achieve that.

It was fairly interesting -- good catch for a foggy day.
