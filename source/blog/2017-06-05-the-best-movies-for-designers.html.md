Design is an overloaded word, but we all get it when we see or experience
it. For software design and achieving usability the basics of design are
indespensible. Understanding why things are placed the certain way and have
certain color is important. Reading about it is great, and I highly
encourage you to buy [Non-Designers Design Book](http://amzn.to/2seIqyg),
but if you prefer to watch something in the moments of relative downtime,
below is the list of movies about design.

## Objectified

Great movie for a general take on Design. Encouraged me to explore things
further.

## BBC - The Genius of Design

This is an excellent take on history of design, and I had fun watching all
five episodes of it. Here I'm linking only the first part, but just stick to
YouTube's navigation and you'll be able to get to four following episodes.

## Helvetica

My interest in design comes from the need of building usable software
products, and you can't really escape the typography for this.

## Design Fundamentals (Code School)

Not a movie per-se, but it's a video training with interactive exercises
about design fundamentals. It talks about things which you may not be aware
of, such as meaning and importance of color, fonts, placement.
