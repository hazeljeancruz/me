MicroISV was on Joel Spolsky MBA list, which I basically follow in my
reading.
Nifty nice little book from Welsh about point of having your own small place
in the universe; you small mill for constructing software and hopefully
having customers for it.

Not a big fan of a books of that kind, however good review of software
testing software was done in this book. AutomatedQA is something pretty
interesting--I was told by a friend of mine such a software doesn't exist,
and here it is.
