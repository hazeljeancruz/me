In The Plex is a very detailed explanation of the insides of Google.

Few big corporations established enough of a cultures and values to actually
drive talented employees towards them, and Google is unquestionably one of
them. Structured after a college dorm Google is the place where most
talented college graduates end up

Search engine started at Stanford, and sponsored by two mentors of Silicon
Valley: Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton moved from being built with
cheap computers in a Beowulf cluster to being a "cloud", still built with
commodity hardware, but with many, many improvements from the software side
to make the search reliable.

Interesting about Google is that the search was so new when they showed up,
that people claimed there's no money to be made with search. Search is
search, not product sites themselves, so what can you do with it? Well,
nothing. Unless millions of people start to click your pages, and then..
Well, if you have attention of millions of people, a lot of things become
easy.

Levy's book quotes "Don't be Evil" policy, which to some no longer touches
Google in 2015. In 2015 Google became the new Microsoft, with Microsoft
being Microsoft. I see many people attributing Microsoft with good words
(heck, even heard from Linux geeks that Windows 7 just works), yet Google is
bu-bu as it spies on your e-mails, shows you creepy adds based on those
e-mails, and additionally sends your love letters to NSA. This is not the
Google Levy described. But oh well..

Interesting is the level of money saving that Levy describes. Google was
built from left-over parts, and it probably still has a power to receive
cheaper parts, when ordering in quantity. Book mentions that software is
providing many, many layers of reliability fat, so that people don't have to
worry about servers being fried and disks dying. That's an interesting
approach. Simply: assume hardware will fail and write your software around
that problem.
