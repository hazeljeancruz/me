I work with command line tools a lot.
If you write and deploy modern software for the cloud, you're probably the
same.
Heck, even Microsoft adopted all possible commmand-line interfaces.
Why? Well, it's a known truth that automating GUI is hard. If one window pops
up in the center, then we send 1 and press Enter, and then another window
shows up, we press X+CTRL and send ENTER. The problem comes up when your
system upgrade popup dialog shows up, the mouse pointer and keyboard cursor
get focuces on the new window, and your automation starts sending stuff to a
unknown application.
