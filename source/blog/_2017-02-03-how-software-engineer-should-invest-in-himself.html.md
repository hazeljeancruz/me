Software engineers can start generating income pretty early on, and they
should think of themselves as a single-person company right away.
I'm fully confident about this now when I'm 29, but when I first heard this
phrase a while back, I didn't really understand what that meant. Here I'll
explain you what it means.

Normal company has money coming in (revenue), money coming out (expenses)
and money that stays (profit). This matches the flow
of money from your salary: you receive your salary every two or four weeks, you
pay taxes, insurance, bills and rent. 

Now companies are smart, and you aren't, because they allocate a budget for
moving ahead of competition with Research and Development. They feed their
troops and have them carve the path towards more revenue. They're Columbus,
revenue is America. 

You must start thinking with the same pattern if you want to be successful.

I looked at the numbers.



Without doing much of data science I can see a pattern: big, established
companies in a specific business sector spend smaller portion of their
income. More diverse companies spend more.

There's an interesting corellation here, because old and well established
companies earn more, a pattern which you're likely going to see in your
career too. So even through VW spends only 5% (as compared to Intel's 20%)
they top the list of R&D spenders ($13B vs $10B). As you become more senior,
your salary will likely grow to the point where you'll be able to have a
decent R&D budget.

Instead of being a total cheapass now think different. Imagine you earn
$100k a year, and you live in California. It's $67.5k after taxes, and
you're going to spend 10% of it to your personal R&D. It's $6.7k a year, or
558 

**Books** Books are pretty cheap, assuming you understand what you're
getting for the price. Popular misconception is that spending $40 for a book
is a lot of money. Of course if you can get this book from the library it's
great, but if you can't, buying it won't destroy you. Depending on where you
live


Looking at 

Devote some percentage of your salary to personal R&D. 






In my
experience it's how you manage your I got my
first money when I was very young. The problem is that it took me a while 

You must run your career like a business.
