Software engineers can start generating income pretty early on. You don't
need permission from anyone, no certificates, no paperwork, no examination.
One day you wake up with your debts and rent paid, either through a job or
contracted work, and you have some excess money.
This is the moment when you should think of yourself as a single-person
company. Not because I want you to go and become a freelancer and be on your own, but
becuase it's easier to understand how to make decent financial decisions
which you won't regret.
Let's talk about this.
For the purposes of our discussion let's assume that if your name is David Roberts, the name
of name your company is "David Roberts LLC".
Write it down, if it helps you: "David Roberts, CEO of David Roberts LLC".
You're in a company mindset now. We can understand what it really means now.

Typical company has money coming in (revenue), money coming out (expenses)
and money that stays (profit). This matches the flow of money from your
salary: you receive your salary every two or four weeks, you pay taxes,
insurance, bills and rent. Whatever is left is up to you to spend.

Companies allocate this excess budget in buckets. Every bucket will go to a
department, and they will decide how to spend it. Facilities department
needs money to keep the place looking good and habitable, so that people are
willing to enter the building and work there. Security department needs
money to protect you from crooks and hackers. And so on, for each
department.

The amount of money allocated to each department much be justified. For example, if
you have an office in a decent part of town, the security department only
needs one guard in front desk to check your badge, and another to monitor
the parking at night. But they don't need an excessive weaponry or an armored
truck.
If you give them three times the usual sum of money, they won't
know how to spend it, and the money will be wasted. Or they'll spend it: buy
a unnecessary equipment which will sit and oxidate,
and the money will be wasted anyway.

It's up to you to manage that. You're the chief in command and you divide
the pieces of the budget pie to your departments. The other quirk
of companies is that you'll be punished by a budget which you didn't spent.
Either someone will be unhappy with you ("I could have used this money if
you didn't fortfeit it") or you'll automatically get less next time.

Some departments require fixed amount of cash. Your kitchen stays the same.
Your entertainment and vacation stay the same too, and are required to keep
you healthy. One thing to know is that these departments don't bring much
levarage, as it's unlikely you'll get ahead of your competition thanks to
the fun you're having. All departments are required and necessary to conduct
business, but departments which move you ahead are: product, sales and
[research and development][].

To move ahead and grow, the company needs constant flow of new developments.
New inventions. This is what R&D is doing.
You must start thinking with the same pattern if you want to be successful.

I looked at the [R&D expenditures][] of big companies. Without doing much of
data science I can see a pattern: big, established companies in a specific
business sector spend smaller portion of their income. More diverse
companies spend more.

|-------------
| No | Company | Spending | Percent of revenue
|----|:----------------|:---------|:------------------
| 1. | Volkswagen | $13.5 billion |  5.2%
| 2. | Samsung | $13.4 billion |  6.4%
| 3. | Intel  | $10.6 billion |  20.1%
| 4. | Microsoft | $10.4 billion |  13.4%
| 5. | Roche | $10 billion | 19%
| 6. | Novartis | $9.9 billion | 16.8%
| 7. | Toyota | $9.1 billion |  3.5%
| 8. | Johnson | $8.2 billion | 11.5%
| 9. | Google | $8 billion |  13.2%
| 10.| Merck | $7.5 billion | 17%
|===================================


There's an interesting corellation here, because old and well established
companies earn more and spend more, a pattern which you're likely going to
see in your career too. So even through Volkswagen spends only 5.2% (as
compared to Intel's 20.1%) they top the list of R&D spenders ($13.5B vs
$10.6B). As you become more senior, your salary will likely grow to the
point where you will be able to have a significant R&D budget.

Instead of being a total spendthrift think different. Imagine you earn
$100k a year, and you live in California. It's $67500 after taxes, and
you're going to spend 5% of it to your personal R&D. It's $3375 a year, or
$281/month. I have picked 5% and not 10% because remember: too much money
will be wasted. For $280 you can subscribe to [Treehouse][] *and*
[Code School][] and [Udacity][], but if you have a full-time job, I
think you won't have enough time to complete all the assignments of
these courses.

In my opinion a range 5%--15% on your own development is fine. Bigger number
doesn't mean a waste. You may want to study and pass a certificate, after
all, and that can cost more.


**Books.** Books are pretty cheap, assuming you understand what you're
getting for the price. Popular misconception is that spending $40 for a book
is a lot of money. Of course if you can get this book from the library it's
great, but if you can't, buying it won't destroy you. Depending on where you
live

**Online classes.** Are probably the second cheapest after books to benefit
from. They cost anything from $0.99 (for 3-month Skillshare.com account)
through $29/month for Code School and Treehouse up to $200/month for
Udacity. Typically the quality is matching "you get what you pay for", but 

**Conferences.** Conferences are good if you want to understand what the top
of your field is doing, and what direction you should take for your career.
You meet with other people who paid their own money for the conference
(typically several hundred dollars), paid for the flight and a hotel. It's
good in the sense 

**College classes.** In Poland you could drop in to the class, sit and
listen. Normally you wouldn't get kicked out, because there's too many
people watching the lecture.
