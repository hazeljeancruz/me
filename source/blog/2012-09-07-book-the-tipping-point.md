  I write this review 4 years after reading this book, and I think
  explanation of mavens/connectors is worth reading. After looking through
  my library I think this book links fairly well with "Innovator's
  Dillemma".

Full title: "The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference"

Interesting take on spreading epidemies of all sorts.

This is actually about word-to-mouth communications between connectors
(people) and mavens (information hubs).

Epidemy of hush puppies is explained here too.

Idea of a new person breaking new grounds and doing something other people
don't consider to be an established standard is explained.

Phenomenon of a broken windows: start preventing small crimes in order to
prevent big crimes.

This is an excellent book, with lots of good ideas applicable to business.
My plan is to revisit it in the middle of this year, to learn about stuff
which I've missed during my first study.
