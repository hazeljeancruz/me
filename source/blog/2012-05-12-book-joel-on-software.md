title:	"Joel on Software"
author: "Wojciech Adam Koszek"
abstract: >
  Spolsky made his mark on the Internet and the software industry with
  his writing, and there are two ways to access it: his blog or this
  book. The book has the same stuff, but comes in a handy form. Get it,
  read it, re-read it many times and assimilate the business/software
  wisdom. By the way, this is a software startup bootstrapping bible.

U la la. Just read. Simply read and enjoy. I think this is number #1 in
terms of "what changed my approach to software engineering".

In order to write this review, I'd have to simply rewrite this book with my
own words, since pretty much everything there shows you real-world approach
on writing and selling your products, and not only.

MUST HAVE for everybody seriously thinking about making software.
