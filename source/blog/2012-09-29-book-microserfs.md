I had a mixed feelings about this one.
It described strange culture of Microsoft and their corporate environment.
I can assume some stuff changed till now (2012), but I wonder how much is
preserved.

My personal experiences shows that the most technically skilled people are
just normal, not "freaky", and they have normal life and families.

Of course there's nothing wrong in spending 20 hours straight trying to
figure out technical problem in your source code.
However when it's your job's habit, it's less fun

Descriptions made me think about "The Soul of a New Machine", which was
similar, and Apple environment described in "iCON" and several others, so it
looks like very geeky behavior across all hi-tech companies in early
computer age.

There's a psychological element in the  book, which I liked.

There's a deep moral too.

You're likely to enjoy it. If I were to recommend you the last book in your
life, this wouldn't be the one. Other than that however, it's worth reading.
