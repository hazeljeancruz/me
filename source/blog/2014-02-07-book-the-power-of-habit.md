Power of Habit outlines just that: what can be achieved if you restructure
your life slightly and align your daily habits to planned targets. I believe
it's from *The Power of Habits* that I learned about *Slow Practice Will
Get You There Faster*, which is still on my reading list, yet sounds very
promising.

The power of very small incremental improvement through the habit which is
touched in Duhigg's book reminded me continuous improvement from the Lean
thinking school of Japanese Toyota engineers.

Probably the most interesting part to me was learning about the Target's
data-science division, where the big data processing on customer data
happens, and when the sale optimization based on the data is performed. I
wasn't aware that Target's paper advertising may be targeted towards the
individual, but now that I think about it, it makes a lot of sense.
