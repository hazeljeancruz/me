Even though that books on whining aren't among ones which I like the most, I
must say that Daisey's title surprised me greatly. This is a very unique
book, both in a style and the content. Author, unlike
[many](http://www.koszek.com/reading/)
ones which I've got to know, with a great distance to himself explains how
it felt to be a part of early days of Amazon.
Moving from customer service through the steps of organizational ladder he
landed in departments which made no sense back then.

Books is a proof that even companies like Amazon, which were funded on a
basis of frugality and customer focus, had a hard time managing rapid growth
in the times where the company doubled every years. Using doors for desks on
one side; sending people merchandise for which they didn't pay on the
other side.

Many other fenomena are explained, such as a drama of Christmas time at
Amazon, where people are dying to be able to deliver shipments on time, with
least amount of problems. Also corporate culture and a cult of Amazon which
developed in early days are explained.

Style is unique to the extent that I'm seriously pondering a detour from my
planned reading lists and picking up some other books my Daisey.
