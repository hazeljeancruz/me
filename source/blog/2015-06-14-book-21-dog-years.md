Even though that books on whining aren't among ones which I like the most, I
must say that Daisey's title surprised me greatly. This is a very unique
book, both in a style and the content. Author, unlike
[many](http://www.koszek.com/reading/)
ones which I've got to know, with a great distance to himself explains how
it felt to be a part of early days of Amazon.
Moving from customer service through the steps of organizational ladder he
landed in departments which made no sense back then.

Style is unique to the extent that I'm seriously pondering a detour from my
planned reading lists and picking up some other books my Daisey.
