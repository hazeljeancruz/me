I started to appreciate bloggers and YouTubers this year. We've got many,
many people pushing great content into the Internet for free, and let me
tell you: I'm not one of them.

After understanding that writing on a regular basis is important, I've tried
to do one blog a week.

One blog a week. Really. This isn't that much if you think about it. I
believed that it'd be around 30 minutes of writing and maybe several more on
proofreading and publishing, but it's official -- I've failed.

Failure reasons:

- it's hard to find a proofreaders for technical content, unless you ask
  friends, who never have time, or always find your stuff "very interesting"

- publishing takes more than 30 minute

- you run out of topics

- you get pushed in real-life and work, and have little energy left at the
  end of a day

- you'd rather write software than blog posts

- "other people will do it for me"

Any of these reasons is valid and holds true and I fell into the trap. So as
of today, my statistics look like this:

```
$ la 2016-0* | grep -v book | wc -l
       8
```

**How to read this:** this year not counting books I've written 8 blog
posts. It should have been something close to 50. This needs changing, and
I think one of the things I'm going to be exploring is just plain old stupid
Wordpress.

Reason?

Simply read this (I fully agree): [Static generators focus on the wrong
thing](http://blog.pankajmore.in/static-site-generators-focus-on-the-wrong-thing).
If you didn't know, the way I write this blog post is by opening a simple
notepad, writing text, and then using this thing called
[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/). And this file later turns into the
website. This works well until you have 200 pages (which I do -- check the
http://www.koszek.com/reading section). Then it takes a long time..

Other than that I need to tie myself with a schedule for writing. As of now
I'm ignoring my Wednesday reminder "To write!" and my Saturday's reminder to
"proofread", but I think this needs to change too.

The biggest reason is basically: if time for writing comes, I would much
rather write software than text, most often. Also topics which I pick
sometimes appear relevant to whatever I'm doing at that very moment. So
sometimes it's iOS related, sometimes it's Mac or UNIX, and sometimes about
business. Unclear if people would actually enjoy reading un-specific stuff
like this.

Things I'll be exploring:

Writing as I go. Work on
[Sensorama](http://www.sensorama.org) led to a lot of studying and
discovering, and I feel like I'll have to review the
[https://www.github.com/wkoszek/sensorama-ios](GitHub repo) to come back to
some of the ideas and conclussions I've reached during writing of it.

It's just November, but these are my reflections.

What is your system for pushing content regularly?
