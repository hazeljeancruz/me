## Forget scalability

You have nothing yet. And you rarely need to scale before launching.
Also you aren't goin 

## Forget testing

## Don't automate stuff unnecessarily

## Forget Continuous Integration

But many of us have problems with **shipping**.

Some people even claim you can't ship a pet project don't as a hobby.

This is bullshit and I don't understand this.

Shipping a hobby project is essential for getting a feeling of
accomplishment. If you write a software that never ships, you waste your
time and you kid yourself. That's not progress.


My claim is that this hurts you. With infinite amount of time, and infinite
amount of resources, we'd never accomplish anything. Now for hobby projects
done in your free time the biggest enemy is you, and your time organization.

You must have a decent work ethic and be a good planner to squeeze some time
for your project. In my opinion you must have a slice of time every day to
work on your stuff.

Testing eats time. At work testing is absolutely required. I like to say
unit tests have a negative development time.


Common wisdom is that if you do something two times.

## 

You should start with as little as minutes, but your
stuff will be progressing slowly

Basically your free time in front of the computer is fairly different from
the time you spend at work. We must agree on that.
