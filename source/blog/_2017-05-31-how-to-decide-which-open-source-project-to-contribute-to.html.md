Contributing to the Open Source makes sense. Most of the time. Let's talk about
projects which you should focus on, depending on your goals.

## Real-world software experience

You must find big, well-established software projects. They must have many people contributing.
The structure of the project must be figured out.
The whole ecosystem behind the project must look fairly serious.
Very often on the website of this project you'll see a name of the foundation slapped somewhere down to the bottom.

Here's the reasoning behind all of this: it must have signs of similarity between typical
commercial setting, where software engineers work for the company. You'll experience the same
benefits and the same frustrations as if it was your job. Examples of such problems are: responsible party 
doesn't like your code. Such person can be hard to get to, be busy, unwilling to help you, have issues
understanding you and your goals. These problems are present in everyday life in the life of the software
project, and if you manage to handle all of it, it'll be a good indicator on how you'll like working in a software
company.
