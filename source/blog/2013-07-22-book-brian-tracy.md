Not too much will be put here.

I decided to give Brian Tracy's book a try, and I'm a little bit
disappointed. Looks like Tracy did what Knuth did for computer science:
collected everything in the one place and brought several contributions.

Most of the stuff in Tracy's books is a collection of examples and quotes
from other authors like Napoleon Hill or Earl Nightingale.

I picked stuff related with saving time and managing your time efficiently.
First was basically "work more, wake up early, go home late" type of advise.
The 2nd was "Getting things done".

I suspect these materials are very good for people who are looking for a
complete set of advices compressed, and present in one place, so that they
don't have to do further study somewhere else.

My opinion can be somehow impacted by my previous readings, and since most
of the stuff starts to repeat across the books, maybe Tracy's were just
unlucky ones, where large amount of content repeated.

It's also so-so feeling knowing Tracy has everything from "How to get rich",
through "How to write a book" to "How to feed your cat while leaving for
vacation". Pretty broad spectrum..

That's about it.
