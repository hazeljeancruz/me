If you were present somewhere close to Bay Area circa 2014--2015, and you've asked
about some resources for entrepreneurs and people interested in startups,
there are 
[several](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2012/05/24/book-the-lean-startup/)
[well-known](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2012/08/24/book-rework/)
[classics](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2012/10/02/book-emyth-revisited/)
which are considered a Mekka of startup knowledge.
Today I'm proud to announce that by audio bookshelf has been extended by 1
important resource and I feel soon it'll become a classic referred to by
many individuals.

Horowitz's "The Hard Thing About Hard Things" is written in a pretty
interesting style. Just like one of the things which you may not know about
[Steve Vai](http://www.vai.com)
is that he's a bee-keeper, you may not know is that Ben Horowitz seems to
be be a fan of certain style of music. Which one? Get to learn it from the book. 
Prelude to each chapter consists of quotations from several artists. I may
not be a big fan of any of them, but I'm a big fan of all drummers which
these people hire for live tours. Consider it a quiz!

The thing I didn't know is that when Horowitz joined Netscape he was equally
old as I am when writing these words (28). The time to join Netscape was the
right one, and after record-setting IPO he moved to the Loud Cloud, which
just like many other entrepreneurial ventures from the Silicon Boom of
2000's was waaay ahead of its time.

From there on started a journey of Horowitz as what he calls a Wartime CEO.
I do agree that many of the resources which I've tapped to help myself
understand modern business better to a large extent concentrate on funding,
building and working with the teams and products. Yet very few explain how
[How](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2012/10/25/book-winning/)
[To](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2012/05/05/book-showstopper/)
[Deal](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2012/12/02/book-the-new-new-thing/)
[With](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2012/12/20/book-the-goal/)
[Problems](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2013/01/13/book-on-the-roll/).

Next thing which I didn't realize that unlike the spectacular 16 months
from the funding to the IPO in the Netscape's case, Loud Cloud Inc and
further Opsware took 8 years of Horowitz's tenure as a CEO.

On of the things about the book is that the title matches fairly accurately
what the book is really all about. As hard topics as laying people off in
difficult times are explained from perspective of people and a CEO. I also
wondered what happens when the CEO ever wants to make a decision against
company's board of directors. Well, this book explains it several times.

This is definitely a good read worth spending couple of bucks on, if you're
interested in how companies work.

Rating, performance improvement, product quality and functionality,
contracts, reverse splits, upset people and all sorts of other issues
explained in 1 books are a great thing. Especially when they come from a
Silicon Valley T-rex.
