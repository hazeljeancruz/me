title:	'Computer History from Giants Themselves'

  I don't subscribe to many YouTube channels, but I've subscribed to the
  Computer History Museum one, since it's a mine on knowledge in my opinion.
  In here I discuss why I believe it is so.

I was an idol driven kid and I’ve always had somebody I admired when
growing up. From the earliest recollections I could trace back in my
memory the very first person was probably my grandfather, the master
tailor. And through him I got to know
[MacGyver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver). I was allowed to
watch MacGyver, since my grandfather believed it would teach me
creativity and also because I loved pocket knifes. Till this day each
time you say something bad about MacGyver, you’ll have an enemy in me,
since it was such an integral part of my growing up and becoming
creative. Same applies to [John Hannibal
Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_%22Hannibal%22_Smith) and
probably [Dr Emmet Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Brown).
The older I got, the more my idols shifted from the fictional characters
to real-world people, and this stayed with me till my adult life.

Nowadays most of my idols are coming from the computer circles. I admire
the most people who built computer systems in the very early days. One
of the privileges of living in Silicon Valley is meeting people who got
to create “Silicon” part of it and who to later shifted to just “Valley”
part, with the growing emergence of software.

[W. Richard Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Richard_Stevens)
was probably one of my earliest UNIX master craftsman. Fairly secretive
author, whom I didn’t know much about. Only recently have I learned how
he looked like. His [“UNIX Networking Programming, Volume
1”](http://amzn.to/1QqCIza) was a hard nut to crack, and I remembered
doing all exercises with great joy and excitement.

Several months ago after [reading quite a
bit](http://www.koszek.com/reading/) about the history of computers, I
discovered something that is probably the best historical resource for
people like me: [Computer History
Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/tag/cpm/) and its
[YouTube
Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHDr4RtxwA1KqKGwxgdK4Vg).
Within it, the [Oral
History](https://www.youtube.com/user/ComputerHistory/videos) series
simply rocks. Here’s one of my favorite picks: Arthur Rock (whom we
could call the very first VC) and Gordon Moore, creator of Intel explain
how Intel came to be:

Other than Computer History Museum, YouTube is full of other resources
on the history of computers. Here’s what I’ve found when I searched for
supercomputer history:

I highly recommend these videos to computer history enthusiasts.
