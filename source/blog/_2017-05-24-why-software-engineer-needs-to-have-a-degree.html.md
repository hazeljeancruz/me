Explosion of computers through rapid hardware and software causes
massive interest in computer science and engineering. You may ask
yourself what's the best way to jump into this industry? On how to get
started?

Many people somehow assume that you can get into software through a
shortcut. That you can short-circuit normal engineering study program to
something very short. Something that would extract an absolute essence, and
just teach you that. For example 12--20 week program. And that afterwards
you'll be able to actually go and get a job.

Similar thing happens in the medical industry in the US. The need for
primary care physicians is so big that people look for ways to shorten the
usual five year medical school program and three years of mandatory
residency.

And while shortcuts can be taken, and study programs compressed, there's a
limit. There's a border which you can't cross while attempting to produce a
human being capable of solving techical problems.

Personally nothing is more wrong. Yes, there are ways to take a shurtcut and
to compress the study. In fact, I've done this. In each of two semesters
I've taken twice the number of usual units. I ended up exhausted and a
little burned out. 


Think for a moment about your computer passion, interest and hobby as a
relationship. You want to get to know the person who you got attracted by.
Instead of committing 4 or 5 years.

For some reason people ass

I did five year continuous study program after which you're receiving a
Masters Degree. Frankly, I entered it with some job offers from Polish
companies, who suggested I switch to part-time studies, since "I won't learn
anything".

They were right.

There are 18.5 million software professionals in the world. Out of that,
3.6 million are in the US. That's 19% percent.

## Management

Whether should you have a degree or not in order to be an active software
engineer is a difficult question. My answer is: you should definitely strive
to get a degree. The highest possible within your capacity, and from the
most prestigious institution you can afford. Let's talk why I'm right here.

## What you need depends on who you are.

In Snowball Warren Buffett mentions that during his birth the chances to be born in
the US were 50 to 1. He continues that he's no smarter than similar kids
from a poor countries, but their path to catch up to what he got to
accept as "granted" was much harder and longer. Frankly, many of these kids
might have never caught up.

Here we use the US as an example. Put "England" or "Switzerland" or "Russia"
or any other country which we consider as an economy when your basic life
requirements are satisfied, and where your intelectual requirements can be
met.

If you're a high-school kid know this: you won't be able to predict now what
you'll need in ten years. It's the same for college students,
