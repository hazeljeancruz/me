Explosion of computers through rapid hardware and software causes
massive interest in computer science and engineering. There's also a 
money effect, since it's widely publicized that "high-tech" pays "a lot".
This causes an influx of people trying to jump on the opportunity and
capitalize on it. You may too, and I applaud the idea.

You probably wonder what's the best way to do it. In here, I can't address
all your questions, of course, since I don't know how old you are, what your
background is or what you've done so far. But my assumption is that you're
somewhere in between 15 and 35, and you want to get into computer business.

**Time** We have two variables here: age and what type of work you'd like to do.
First of all: **you can't teach an old dog new tricks** is likely to be
wrong, but the truth about age is that it's easier to concentrate,
assimilate new content and start using it. But it's also about time
allocation: you have more time when younger. On the other hand the more
seasoned you are, more analogies and comparisons you can make between
abstract concepts. Some things in the software/hardware relationships I've
understood pretty late in my life. I guess I had to grow up to understand
them. Chances are high you're similar.

The most important is to get into the process of educating yourself well. By
that I mean prioritizing things which you care about. If you want to build
websites, there's no point in learning computer architecture. If
you want to work in the industry, it's pretty clear you need to know
algorithms, computer architecture and 

With "time" taken care of, you must understand what your target is. Writing
software as a hobby is much easier than writing software as a job. While the
first is playing guitar with a bunch of friends in a garage, and maybe
performing at your school's reunion, building industry grade software is
like performing live during Grammy's. That's a huge difference.

**High-tech** is a wide term, which encompasses building computer hardware,
electronic devices, and later makes software which powers these systems. It
also means building software that runs on computers and phones. If you're
reading this, there's a high chance you want to write software.


Now depending on your age, my advise to you 


you probably want
to write software. High-tech also includes hardware: building physical
systems with real chips, real PCBs and real chassis powered by real power.
Less people want to do this nowadays. Comparign salaries between hardware
and software business, it's understandable. Elecronics industry, even
through very satisfying (I've worked at Xilinx), is considered less sexy,
and somewhat less dynamic. It's true, and my guess is that even electrical
engineers end up doing software at some point. 

There are two ways of getting 

Many people somehow assume that you can get into software through a
shortcut. That you can short-circuit normal engineering study program to
something very short. Something that would extract an absolute essence, and
just teach you that. For example 12--20 week program. And that afterwards
you'll be able to actually go and get a job.

Similar thing happens in the medical industry in the US. The need for
primary care physicians is so big that people look for ways to shorten the
usual five year medical school program and three years of mandatory
residency.

And while shortcuts can be taken, and study programs compressed, there's a
limit. There's a border which you can't cross while attempting to produce a
human being capable of solving techical problems.

Personally nothing is more wrong. Yes, there are ways to take a shurtcut and
to compress the study. In fact, I've done this. In each of two semesters
I've taken twice the number of usual units. I ended up exhausted and a
little burned out. 


Think for a moment about your computer passion, interest and hobby as a
relationship. You want to get to know the person who you got attracted by.
Instead of committing 4 or 5 years.

For some reason people ass

I did five year continuous study program after which you're receiving a
Masters Degree. Frankly, I entered it with some job offers from Polish
companies, who suggested I switch to part-time studies, since "I won't learn
anything".

They were right.

There are 18.5 million software professionals in the world. Out of that,
3.6 million are in the US. That's 19% percent.

## Management

Whether should you have a degree or not in order to be an active software
engineer is a difficult question. My answer is: you should definitely strive
to get a degree. The highest possible within your capacity, and from the
most prestigious institution you can afford. Let's talk why I'm right here.

## What you need depends on who you are.

In Snowball Warren Buffett mentions that during his birth the chances to be born in
the US were 50 to 1. He continues that he's no smarter than similar kids
from a poor countries, but their path to catch up to what he got to
accept as "granted" was much harder and longer. Frankly, many of these kids
might have never caught up.

Here we use the US as an example. Put "England" or "Switzerland" or "Russia"
or any other country which we consider as an economy when your basic life
requirements are satisfied, and where your intelectual requirements can be
met.

If you're a high-school kid know this: you won't be able to predict now what
you'll need in ten years. It's the same for college students,

# Get a degree

Get a degree, if possible. If you're in the US especially, getting a degree
from **any** school is likely to give you enough background to get into the
engineering profession. While targetting top 10 schools is a good idea,
targetting 10 others will get you a solid understanding of programming
concepts. If at all possible, by all means get a degree.

Go to a community college, take as many math and CS classes as possible.
Then transfer to a better school, and repeat the process. As of 2017 you
should put less pressure on programming technologies and languages, and more
on hard science, like: statistics, linear algebra and algorithms.
Programming languages are trends that aren't really that important to your
future, in my opinion. If you've learned to program well in C++, Python or
Java, you should be able to learn other programming languages from a book.

My take on the US universities is that even the lesser known schools give
great education. If you can downsize, move to another state and study at the
state school, you should probably do it.

First of all the universities here are much more up-to-date with the
industry. The study programs prepared by a
