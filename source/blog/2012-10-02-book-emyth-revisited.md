Wow!

Full title is "E-myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and
What to Do About It" and let me tell ya, oh boy, oh boy. He really meant
it!

This is absolutely truly magnificent view on the meaning of your own
business. This is a true black hat for those, who think that thanks to the
skill of doing something on a decent level, they can grow to be a business
owner.

Think of this book as a protective mental break from quiting your job and
jumping straight to selling our half-baked software products on eBay for
$19.95.

Not that it's not cool, but I'm just saying..

Gerber did a perfect job at explaining the concept of running your own company
by enlisting 3 main features which every business owner must assimilate
deeply in his brain:
+ to be a entrepreneur -- create business opportunities which other people
  don't see. Figure out possible projects, which manager could supervise.
  Give just about enough assistance to the manager on how this project could
  possibly by implemented.
+ to be a manager -- break the idea of entrepreneur to steps and pieces and
  start making them happen.
+ and a technician -- work bi.. dog. Work dog. Which is always like a
  watchdog, but for working harder.

The mix must be matched 33.3333% to be successful.

To exemplify what it really is, he gave an example of apple pie store owner,
who's excellent at baking pies, but very poor at making her company work on
her.

The difference between having a business and having a job is explained here
to, and some advises on how to not make former turn to later are given.

Structure of the book was quite interesting: it started as a light-weight
introduction on how business works and short introduction to "The American
way" of living. Then goes really realistic history of Sarah, the store owner
(mentioned earlier in my review), but next this book suddenly turns to
a copy of "The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" and ends with a really,
really deep and unexpected moral.

However, this is probably one of the most important books about business
I've read so far. Highly recommended reading for anybody thinking about
something more than an American 8hr/5day/lifetime dream.
