This book was on my TODO for quite a while, as I was in the search for a
some answers related to problems founders of startups and individual
projects face.

Have you ever had an idea and wanted to collect a team of friends and
execute them? If so, you'll know what these problems might be.

The feel of the book is similar to the Millionaire's Mind, as the author
relates to his broad study and statistical evidence across a lot of
startups.
The issue is that only small number of these startups are used for the main
thread of a discussion.
