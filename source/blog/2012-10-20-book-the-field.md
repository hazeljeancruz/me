Full title: "The Field--The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe"

I somehow didn't like this one. I think author is wrong and the fact that
people driving in the same and saying the same thing is just a beauty of
randomness, and not the result of communicating subconsciously.

I liked some ideas in the sense I liked but refused to accept Hill's claim
that "Law of Success" is the law of nature. I just don't believe in things
like that.

Lynne, I don't buy it :)
