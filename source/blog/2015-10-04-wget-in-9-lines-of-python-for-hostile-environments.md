  Bootstrapping a system on a UNIX distribution where not all the tools
  are installed and those installed are out-of-date can be challenging. I've
  missed `wget` on Synology distro, and I show how you can work-around it.

HTTPS seems to be everywhere these days, including GitHub. Itâ€™s great to
see the security of the Web improved, but sometimes this comes at a
cost. Recently I wanted to actually fetch and test my own repository for
bootstrapping my storage box from Synology:

[https://github.com/wkoszek/synology](https://github.com/wkoszek/synology)

The DS214play model which I have comes with the `wget` program without
HTTPS, so doing a command line bootstrapping is difficult. This is one
of this weird chicken-and-egg problems we sometimes experience, and to
test my software releases published on GitHub, I wrote this simple
thing, which lets me fetch the release and do further bootstrapping and
testing:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/wkoszek/48b4ac725664d324c9d5.js"></script>

Oh, and GitHub Gists are HTTPS too, so to actually get it, I had to
transfer the content through PasteBin;

~~~shell
wget -O - 'http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=PcbNtyh9' | tr 'r' ' ' > wget2
chmod 755 wget2
./wget2 https://github.com/wkoszek/synology/archive/0.0.4.zip
~~~

Why like that? Well in the middle of testing it, I learned that:
