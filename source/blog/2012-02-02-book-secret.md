title:	"Secret"
author: "Wojciech Adam Koszek"
abstract: >
  Dan Harris of ABC News summarized this genre of books accurately, and
  I think all of us would agree.. Slightly esoteric, but got me started
  in the personal development field. In my opinion this book changed my
  life for a plus. Check it out. But be critical.

This is where the story with "new school" Hill-alike books started. This
book wouldn't have been such a big and significant step on my reading list,
however:

+ it was recommended to me by my mother, who got it by accident and
suggested I may like it
+ it was first book of that kind that I've read
+ in the Polish edition of this book a lot of other authors of similar books
were mentioned...

So the book talks about what I could now call "typical positive thinking"
methodology, meaning: motivation and habit of trying to achieve your
precisely stated goal is all there is to be successful.

In general, I think the last point from the list above was very interesting.
I seem to recall that the book made a very good impression on me, since the
general concept of will and power of your own thinking is something that
suits my atheistic point of view on the world. But I was impressed by number
of authors that somehow contribute to these methods.

Several authors were mentioned, and to this day I don't know anybody from
the list, except the one parson - Bob Proctor.

The only reason is that I think it was the only single person that had
something on YouTube. I didn't like it much, unlike his biography from
Byrne's book:

*"Bob Proctor's wisdom came to him through lineage of great teachers..."*

So here I was -- being introduced to the 2 big names of all time..

So Rhonda's book was great in terms of its content, however I must honestly
say introducing me to Napoleon Hill and Earl Nightingale might be the
biggest contribution this book did to me. I seem to recall right after
finishing the book and reading the cover, I found series of video lectures
on YouTube straight from the Mr Hill, and due to excellent quality of the
recordings, I soon learned who guru is..
