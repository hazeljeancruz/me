Markdown is a text markup format. It's very universal, so that you can write
it in any software. Even simple Notepad can be good enough to write
markdown.


Images. And links.


Even if you don't like Windows, some tools there were great. One of them was
[WinAmp][], probably the best audio player around. (do you know a replacement
for OSX? Let me know!)

Another was [Total Commander][]--the 2 pane file commander. Total Commander
could do anything you could think of for file management.
Its UI was like [Norton Commander][]'s: the
"blue background" file manager for DOS.

I missed this functionality for OSX. I like Finder and it's preview
feature, and I like an embedded image editor, but for shuffling files Finder is terrible.

So I started from [the page on file managers][] on Wikipedia, and learned about Orthodox File Managers".

The idea is that on the left you have one directory, on the right you have
another one, and you have a set of shortcuts for shuffling files back and
forth. You can copy, move, rename, delete files. In a good manager the
source/destination can be anything: another folder, another computer in the
network, a website server etc.

So what's there for OSX?

[This is a great thread][] on really good file managers for OSX.

I've tried some of this stuff, but muCommander beat them all:

[mucommander][]

Looks simple, but is pretty powerful. You should start playing with it and I
think you'll like it. I like it too.
