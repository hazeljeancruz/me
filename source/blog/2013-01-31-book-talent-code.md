Full title: The Talent Code: Greatness Isn't Born. It's Grown. Here's How.
author: "Wojciech Adam Koszek"
address: "Menlo Park, CA"

As opposed to "Talent is overrated", this book covered topics touching
scientific parts of talent, like myelin presence, meaning, production and
others.

Melanin is related with neuron training and communication, leading to better
structure of human brain.

Here too information about not really recognizing something like "talent"
has been confirmed.

Interestingly author shows examples of top performers, who asked about the
practice revealed, there there's absolutely no unique or extraordinary
secret about they. Some of them were unable to identify anything special
about their practice.

Funnily, well performing sportsman very often don't spend much time on
actual practice in a common sense. Football players do not spend hours and
hours on the field. When they actually apply is "effective practice"

Effective practice means growing and expanding now only actual target
skill, but also knowledge and "comfort zone" in their field.

Thus young tennis players when tested, turned out to play only several hours
per week, but were caught watching tennis matches over and over on their
VHS.

Important concept of pushing your experience further was explained. This
felt like an analogy of JoJo Mayer instructional DVD on snare drum
technique: you're supposed to practice only rudiments which you're not yet
perfect at.

Deep practice is exemplified by comparing the results out of the interviews
with beginners and advanced musical instrument players. Beginners described
they perception of the practice as a nice, positive experience. Advanced
guys however drawn a practice room as a Hell with a Devil himself inviting
them to it, and the act of practice as a punishment.

Digging further had shown advanced people understood practice is about
learning new stuff and making mistakes first, and gradually fixing them
later.
