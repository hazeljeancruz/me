This book would fit pretty well with "The Talent Code" and "Talent is
overrate". Carol Dweck explains problem solving approaches and the attitude
towards doing so.

Growth and fixed mindset are the main approaches  for this book. Fixed
approach is when a person assumes no change can be made. Or when failure
labels him with a loser's tag. Or when a single digit or event makes him
feel like it's not his thing.

Growth mindset's characteristics is about ability to adjust to failure, and
being able to recover from lost.
