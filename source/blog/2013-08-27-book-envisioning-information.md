Edward Tufte's books were on my TODO for 2 years now (I got the 4 pack from
somebody who apparently participated in the tutorial), but haven't had a
chance to actually read them.

Pretty difficult to start from due to the artistic vocabulary and pretty
dense language, I proceed with "Envisioning information" as the first book
from the collection.

Pretty amazing research has been done to create a book of that type.
Examples of the art forms comes from several centuries and spun many
countries.

Presenting information is a very difficult subject, having learned it at a
daily job. Needing to present 4 combination of experiments across 5
temperatures, 5 voltage levels of different types of units, I must say book
is very inspirational.

With new technologies like WebGl and d3.js the knowledge gained will turn to
be helpful each time bigger portion of the data has to be "compressed" from
many dimensions to just 2.

Also thing this is emphasized, which I could say I didn't really realize is
the resolution of the print as compared to the resolution of modern
displays. Paper still rules. The next visualization system I'll have to
design I'll try to make around the concept of actually printing content,
instead of just viewing interactively on the screen.

Really great for information designers, but also for any graphic designers.
I'd also recommend it to website designers for anything that has to show
complex datasets.
