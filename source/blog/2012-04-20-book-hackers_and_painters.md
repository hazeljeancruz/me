I'm catching up with a list of computer classics and reading Graham's **Hackers and painters**

I really expected this book will be about bearded guys arguing about **Linux
vs GNU/Linux** and about how we all eat in front of the LCD screens, bend
our necks over laptops with USB flashlights etc..

**Books positively surprised me**

Really nice take on business and technology. Mix of things in about right
proportions.

This book is a statement of "Start small" and "growing business".

***To remembered***:

+ Graham mentions LISP, which was a valuable platform for development of their
Web store creator. Well, it's the 2nd author of ISV/software
engineering/business books, except [Joal
Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) that I've read who mentions LISP.
This automatically extended my Amazon wishlist queue.

+ **If your customers won't buy your software
anyway, you don't loose anything by giving them software for free**. It was
in the context of piracy.
I think this is why lots of companies (even EDA companies charging $$,$$$
and $$$,$$$ per license) provide free variants of their tools.

+ **Customer service exceeding expectations** 1st and one of the most
frustrating things after moving to the US is: "Welcome.... Press 1 to ...
Press 9". Graham says they were picking up phones by themselves (I see an
analogy between Graham and [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/)).

+ **Making tools right for the job** Seems like Viaweb had several useful
tools and toolkits hacked by themselves that made them more effective. This
is something frequently overlooked.

+ **Amount of wealth isn't constant** This is something people from
ex-socialist countries should read.

In general, I'd made this book mandatory for all CS/EE students.
