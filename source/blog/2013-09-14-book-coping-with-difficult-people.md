Title looked appealing to me, since I believe many people in the corporation
I work for must have real problems with interacting with me. I too sometimes
experience difficulties and have a chance to observe all sorts of unexpected
behaviors.

The author puts certain classes of personal characters into categories:
sherman tanks, snipers, exploders, complainers, silent ones not
participating in anything, the ones that agree with everything but don't
produce any results, bulldozers and other.

Each of them is a ticking social bomb which is going to explode in a
different time.

For each of them he gives the background and the possible ways to handle the
troublesome human being.

If you work in a big corporation, I think you must have experienced each of
the behaviors mentioned. This book will provide an explanation and ways to
show why some people behave like that.

Useful resource.
