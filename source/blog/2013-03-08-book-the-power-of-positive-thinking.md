One of the books that I didn't quite "get", and thus didn't really enjoy.
The thing is that unlike other positive thinking lectures, this position is
strictly religion intensive. Basically it felt like a study on God and
religion, with the flavor of success in life.

Nothing bad in this approach. It just didn't suit me. The book is too very
traditional--passes only values which could be considered as "old".

Compared to Ziglar's or Rohn's teachings, I saw more orthodox approach here.
I decided to finish it only because all big names in the industry mention it
as a basis for their works.
