Covey's classic was well-known around my company. Looks like at some point
in time this book was handed to people. Some of them claimed they were
forced to read it.

I think "renegotiating agreement" is something that is often heard in a big
Silicon Valley corporations, and which I think comes straight from this
book.

I'm pretty sure "managing expectations" also has its roots here.

Put first things first.

Not sure if it appeared in the written version of the book, but audiobook
had an excellent "Green and clean" essay presented. Very nice.

Recommend if you occasionally and accidentally often people through e-mail.
