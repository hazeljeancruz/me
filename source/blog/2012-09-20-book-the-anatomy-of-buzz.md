How the word spreads.

You work on one thing, you don't tell too many people about it. You get an
e-mail about this thing and you wonder: how is that possible ?

This book shows numerous of cases like that. It does explain why people form
networks and how knowledge about products flow through the networks.

Ever heard of Derek Sivers? Ever heard how his CD-Baby business kept growing?
This is an exact explanation of the whole phenomenon.

Buzz happens for good and bad products. It's better to be identified with
the former.

Worth reading.
