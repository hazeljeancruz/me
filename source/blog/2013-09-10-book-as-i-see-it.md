After great "How to be rich" I decided to immediately order the 2nd book by
the oil magnate.

Couple of first chapters were interesting as they showed the life of the man
that had it all. He explains his personal life starting from childhood
through school, ending on his failures in 5 marriages.

Then he explains state of his business and the way people view and see him.
Mentioned is the fact that, just like in Sam Walton's case, "the richest
man" ranking has put him in a lot of trouble..

After first chapters there's large part of the book that explain Getty's
personal view of various random matters, and is interleaved with lots of
personal stories..

Personal stories start to be quite tiring, since Getty mentions them all
over the book. At some point is started to feel he starts to show off with
the number and "quality" of people who he knew.

But the true is that the book shows from the 1st person perspective how
tiresome owning a great business can be, and what the personal implications
are.

I'd say I'd be happier now reading this book, so if you want to read
something much better, I recommend "How to be rich" much more.
