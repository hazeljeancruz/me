This is one of the well recognized corporate classics.

Perfect beginning, which is true, so I started to read on and continued
(line by line) up until the end.

Excellent storyline with some good advises about communicating with people
during projects you guys are working on.

Without rewriting portions of the book I can say lots of good points are
raised in this position and I'd consider this as "MUST READ" for every
single manager.
