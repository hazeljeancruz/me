Full title is "Rich Dad Poor Dad: What The Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor
and Middle Class Do Not!"

I think it was one of the first pieces about collecting wealth that I've
read. Typically it's relatively boring, and few authors can dress useful
content in a decent storyline. Kiyosaki managed to succeed.

Narrator introduces the whole thing as having the best friend, and using his
father's advise for proceeding with business approach. Rich Dad.

Poor Dad works in the opposition of the Rich Dad. Poor Dad is educated, but
poor. Works for money, instead for himself. Additionally doesn't have a way
to pass a financial knowledge to his son, since he doesn't have any.

Rich Dad is a true entrepreneur and shows how to do useful work with little
work. Narrator learns it in a painful way after starting to work for a Rich
Dad.

Rich Dad even gets called "A crook" once.

Interesting question about lack of financial literacy among the society is
mentioned. It funny how little people know about investing after finishing
high-school (at least from my Polish perspective).

The idea for working for yourself is mentioned. It's like "Give hungry a
fish, he'll eat one day; teach him for to fish, and won't be hungry ever".

Highly recommended.
