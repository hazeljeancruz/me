After a busy day of debugging you went grocery shopping. After starying for
eight hours straighs into the iTerm, being in the avocado section felt like
a breeze. And then you enter home.

## Cooks

You enter the kitchen and it's a mess. You're scared of putting your bags
full of fresh, organic produce. Germs are everywhere, after all, and you
know it. The tabletop is sticky. Hard to be surprised--you can't really
recall when it was last cleaned. Or who did it. For sure it wasn't you. Not
since you started living here.

Stove has leftovers of soup. Or butter. Or a salad. Hard to say. This gluey
stuff around the electric spiral used to be something, for sure, but now
it's just greese.  It burns, smokes and smells each time you boil yourself
an egg, but normally it's too late to do anything about it anyway, so you
just leave it like this.  At this point it doesn't matter--the walls around
and the ceiling look disguisting anyway. Since the last explosion of burning
oil and an accident with a blender it doesn't make much of a difference.

You scrub a dirt from a floor with your left flip-flop, and put bags there.
Left hand close to the opened fridge, and right in a bag.

But wait.

Fridge is full. Not just full. Not simply full. Not full as in: I can't
really fit my new grocery from the floor there. It's full of things no
longer have proper name. Rotting vegetables, old cheese and sauces with no
due date. Were their yours? Or your roommates? I mean one of them might have
got them, but you don't know which one.

That's fine. It's not the first time this happens.

Before groceries land in there, the fridge needs serious cleanup. You throw
bags of goo out, but since the trashcan is full and it's too cold to go back
out now, you just dump the decomposting stuff into the sink. Just for now,
you kid yourself, but there's no other way. You took the old soy milk
cartoon out, soon to realize it was there to hold a shelf.

You could in theory just ignore everything and screw a bolt in there to hold
the shelf, but who has time for this now. You just stick the old cartoon
back in there, but mark it as "DO NOT DRINK EVER".

From fridge to sink. Now from bags to fridge. You just prevent yourself from
running into the same mistake, so things get labels: when you got them and
what's the time by which to toss them away.

That's it about the kitchen improvements here. The compost in the sink stays
there. You might manage to wash a piece of vegetable there on the side, and
with one eye on your freshly cooked vegetables and meat with sprinkling
olive oil, you manage to dig a place and clean a fork for yourself.

## Hackers

Looking at [https://news.ycombinator.com](HackerNews) and
[https://www.reddit.com](Reddit) I have a feeling ninety percent of focus is
on software implementation, which is like cooking a dinner in the above
story. But every day is quite different: to be able to actually implement
a software product, you must first start from all the crap work that needs
to be done. Large number of people don't see that, and if you do, you'll
move ahead fast.

You'll notice
that great software engineers can derive pride and some form of satisfaction
of just being in the
kitchen. The act of ripping the code apart and putting it back, better,
together is what makes them like software. And doing all these surrounding
activities is what makes a great cook great. Making yourself find at least
some joy in doing a full cycle of software development is important, since
otherwise the mental burnout happens. So try to get interested in testing,
release engineering, documentation, performance analysis and not just
writing code.

What I believe happens as a side effect of this process of "building
software" is that you start to appreciate all the people who do a tremendous
amount of crap-work and sometimes don't get enough recognition. You see a
reliable unit-test suite in the product you're contributing to? Well,
there's this one person who might have put a huge amount of work to make it
work reliable. Always remember that.
