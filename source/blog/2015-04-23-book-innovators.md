Probably the most comprehensive study on the history and current state of
computing and innovation. From Ada Byron to Bill Gates. From mechanical
computers, through tubes to the transistor. Explained is the history of
modern computing.

Chapter 3 reminded me that in the early days people building computers
didn't recognize the domain of programming at all. It's quite fascinating to
think that I graduated from a domain which 50 years earlier wasn't even
recognized. In the old days people building computers would write
programs, and due to the nature of their programming (low-level programming
with 0 abstraction of hardware interfaces) it's hard to be surprise by that
state of things.

I've learned about the existance of "As we may think" by Vannevar Bush, but
yet have to read it. Seems like this piece had a great impact on many
people, including guys like
[Marc Andressen](http://www.twitter.com/pmarca/).

The "On games" reminded me a lecture from Computer History Museum YouTube
channel, in which Bill Joy explained that during his presentation of
Ping-Pong game on Sun machine, VCs who didn't know what it is but felt it
was cool, were pulling wallets and giving checks for 6-7 figures in hope
computers and computer networks will prove to be important.
