## Abstract

In this talk I'm going to talk about lessons learned from building Sensorama
[http://www.sensorama.org](http://www.sensorama.org), an Open Source sensor platform for data science.
The main theme of the talk will be Open Source: what is great about it, what
is bad and how you must become a part of the Open Source
community to really move quickly and benefit from it.
For this project, I did both the code and the design, so you'll have a chance to see how
solo-developer deals with time/feature constraints, which tools I've used
and what my approach towards development in this mode is.
In other words: I'll tell you what I did to stay sane.
If the iOS development were a walk in a dark city park, this talk may turn
out to be your flashlight. If you like it, star it at GitHub:
