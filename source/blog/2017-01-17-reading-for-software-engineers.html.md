I would argue that without reading, you're wasting a lot of time.
"Good people borrow, and great steal". I know few software engineers, who
don't read and yet still write amazing software. But there are very few of them.
I bet you're not one of them, actually.
And most of their time, they do waste *some* time too.
Very few of us solve unique problems. You're probably not the lucky guy either.

In my opinion, you won't be very good and well respected, unless you read.

## Motivation

I just came back from a "meetup". Small informal mini-conference which
people around here organize. It happens on a monthly basis. You get free
talk, free pizza and sometimes get solicited to help someone. Or they try to
recruit you. But in general: it's a free-though meeting and idea exchange.

One talk was by a book author. A question was raised on why her book topic
touches "Swift", a popular programming language, instead of being more
general. The author replied she had picked a topic she knew would have a
shelf life longer than 6 months.

This made me think.

## New books are mostly worthless. Skip them.

Not the first time technical author expresses a worry that topics in
computers change rapidly, and they can't keep up with writing the material.

But here's the secret: it's 10% true.

Most of the rudimentary topics don't change and won't change. The reason?
Underlying hardware, software and algorithm principles don't oscillate or
get outdated. Not unless we get completely new paradigms, like quantum
computers. But right now: it's all 0s and 1s flipping back and forth, very
quickly.

It's all the same stuff, wrapped differently.

It's like getting a candy packaged in a red silver wrapping. And then
getting a candy packaged in a green silver wrapping. On the surface it's
very different, but it's the same candy.

The problem is that new books (lets say 2010--...) are mostly about
wrappings. Older books talk about universal values. Example: the publisher
Morgan Kaufmann made so many great books in the past. The new ones are often
a collection of conference papers. Many authors, inconsistent style. Not
worth a buck. Keep buying older books.

## For writers interested in money

Authors have to struggle with it. In my opinion: if you're a writer and you
like this kind of stuff, it should be great for you: keep writing about
candy wrappings, and people who are your audience and who want to stay
up-to-date will keep buying your books.

Think of Donald Knuth or Richard Stevens books. Stevens taught me UNIX
and I have Polish and English edition of each of his books. And he delivered
high-quality examples, in a source code form. And it's still very useful.
If you know any other authors whose work you like, let me know.
For a writer and a publisher: it's terrible. I baught these books once, and
that's it. I don't new copies ever again. Poor business.

## Things worth reading about

If you're a reader, my suggestion to you: start selecting literature so that
things you learn are universal.

It's fine to get a book on some particular technology. I have a book on
Rails 4. Rails 5 is around, but still most of the stuff in the book is true.
In 2 years it won't, but I'll be a part of the active "Rails developers
community" by then, so I'll notice.

Which things are those? It's pretty easy, if you look around.

Some stuff you may want to read about:

**Methodology doesn't change. Read book on it.** 
There are some new inventions
every now and then, but most of experts know they don't bring even 2x
improvement in productivity. Maybe 20% improvement. Or 5%.

**Process doesn't change (much). Read book on it.**

**Coding style and its importance doesn't change**. It's a universal software engineering
stuff. It's slightly different for each technology and even a project, but
its principles don't change. **Read book on it**

**Networking concepts don't change (much)**. If you have time, read TCP/IP
Illustrated. This stuff isn't going away.

**Software architecture and patterns don't change**. This is like grammar for software
engineering. You can make a prose with made up words, but 99% of software
has signs of being architected according to a well-known patterns.

**Testing doesn't change. Read book on it.**

**UI design doesn't change (much). Read book on it** If you pick book on old Win3.1 UI design and
it's principles, it's pretty much the same.

**Databases and data models don't change much. Read book on it** One of the
things I slightly regret is that I wasn't paying more attention during my
databases courses (didn't like it back then) Now I do, and I'm catching up.
But these concept re-surface everywhere: in embedded databases (Realm),
Rails (ORM) and everywhere else.

## Hints for you

Read a book and take a break. Technical stuff isn't prose and your brain
will burn more calories processing stuff.

If the book has source code examples, retype them and try them out.

Never copy and paste stuff from ready-to-use examples. Unless you write
stuff with your own hands, I guarantee you that your recall will be maybe
10%.

Do the homework. If the book has exercises, try to do them. Challenge
yourself to go through them and see how much and why you were off.

Fiddle with content in your head. Keep asking yourself questions and trying
to answer them. Find additional material on Google. Find YouTube videos,
podcasts and animations showing concepts you've learned about. People recall
video best, then podcasts and then text. It's best to have multi-media
source of knowledge to stimulate your brain. And there's research on that.

Try to mix it up. I find it hard to read two software architecture books
back-to-back.

Don't read more than one book at a time. I get confused and discouraged and
it's hard for me to come back to the context at which I've left of.

# Missing books

There's some new stuff which I think isn't very well covered. For example
distributed computing isn't very well covered. If you've asked me, I
wouldn't know what to recommend. It's weird, because it's around for a
while, but I think it's (a) a domain of big companies with busy people who
don't like writing books (b) it changes quickly due to increasing demand for
bigger systems (c) is tied to companies. Google, Facebook and other big
companies have their own distributed software frameworks.

# Summary

Reading is important. You'll be better of reading, as it gives you more
experience, more perspective and makes you a better expert. You gain more
tools in a box, and you're more appropriate for doing interesting work which
may come your way by accident.
