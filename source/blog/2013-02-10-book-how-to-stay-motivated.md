It was one of my favorite audio recordings.

One of the longest too.

I didn't know Zig Ziglar till the study of "50 prosperity classics" and "50
success classics".  His name was mentioned there, and in a pretty strange
way.  For me it felt like anti-advertising slogan stating Ziglar preaches
old-school, Christian way of life, being a father of multiple children and
orthodox beliefs.  Not being sure what the "traditional" school of positive
thinking is, I decided to give Ziglar's book a try.

My interpretation was very positive.

I'm not a fan of typical religious preachings, I must say he uses religion
in a very non-invasive way, which didn't bother me at all.  I'd say his
treatment of religion actually helps to pass the message to people, since in
my opinion majority of people got their roots in religion of some kind.
Thus, this message is relatively well understood.

Ziglar is a great speaker. One of the best I've heard. He uses sense of
humor in a very subtle way, which greatly helps him with his presentations.

He uses a lot of personal stories (about redhead!) to back his thoughts.

The message is very similar to Steven Covey's "7 habits". If you've already
read this one, you can consider Ziglar's book as a complementary reading.
Otherwise, I suggest you get it.
