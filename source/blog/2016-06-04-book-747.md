An amazing insight into the building of the  biggest passenger
plane of that time. This book does a good job at explaining what
building complex engineering projects are all about. One of the
phrases that stuck with me was that the plane is designed so
that all the parts can be serviceable and testable, and whole
which are too deeply buried inside of the structure of the
plane must last 20 years.
