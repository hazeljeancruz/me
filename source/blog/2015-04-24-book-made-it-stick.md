Accelerating learning should probably be my logical step before I started to
read and listen to (audio) books, yet I came to this topic quite late.
During one of the trips back home in KQED I've listened to a great podcast
entitled: "Science of Smart" where a research of Roedriger was mentioned.

General message out of this book is that studying-by-repeating and cramming
for exams are the most common "learning" techniques applied by students of
high-school and universities. Yet the research proves that it's testing and
quizing that actually helps us retain the knowledge and actually master it.

One of the examples given is that good teachers (couches) know how to
diversify a training for their teams so that th

Spaced repetition is one of the techniques mentioned too. According to the
research spaced-repetition leads to much more effective retention than
anything else.

Diversifying the practice also brings good results, and trying to use as
much of a power of our associative minds leads to much better results.
This is a theme mentioned by Brian Tracy in his "Accelerated Learning
Techniques" where he's

One of the colleges mentioned was said to have teachers give assignments for
classes that were to happen in the future, so that students unfamiliar with
the topic can challenge their minds and try to solve problems by doing
individual research.

Reading and understanding is just an illusion of knowing. Quite likely this
illusion comes from the fact that while reading, we think that by
understanding words, sentences and general meaning of a text we actually
assimilate the knowledge.
