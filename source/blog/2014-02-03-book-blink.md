Blink is probably one of the best books of 2014 for me and it positively
surprised me. Gladwell touches on the subject of rapid assessments done in
various domains of life, including doctors and scientists.

Chapter number one introduced me to the general outline of the book and
Gladwell did it in a way to attract the reader. Unlike other audiobooks on
which I sometimes zoned out and lost focus, his book made me pay attention.
Certain fragments I listened to more than once, just to be able to increase
my knowledge assimilation.

Story of Gottman is quite frankly something that people in big corporations
can experience too, but unlike in marriage, they see it through recruiting.
During the job interview most often than not you can tell the good candidate
from the bad one and do it fairly rapidly.

Paul Van Riper story on Millenium 2000 challenge was probably the most
inspiring. Made me do some additional studies into the ``Battlefield
theory'' and some interviews with The Master.

Mostly from the ``How to be in Command and Out of Control'':

So there were many good stories and comparison mentioned on people requiring
sub-second time to perform complex judgements in the situation of a disaster
or an emergency, with Millenium 2000 being my favorite.
