Dropbox popularized the idea of cloud storage. They were the first
widely used product which normal people like my mother could understand.
On OSX Dropbox is integrated very well with the OS. In fact, you can see
Dropbox as a folder and basically forget that the files which you save
locally will be transmitted on the server in the background.

On a daily basis I use Google Drive, but when I got an iPad, I thought
it'd be good to keep Dropbox as my iPad backing store, so that I don't
get distracted with my normal stuff. I intended to keep PDFs, books and
other documents in Dropbox so that I could use my iPad for productive
work.

First surprise: iOS version of Dropbox isn't well suited for this. To my
knowledge there's no way to synchronize the whole directory for offline
access. Basically when I wanted to make my directory called "PDFs"
available offline, I had no way to do so. My solution to the problem was
to go through my documents and tag them for offline reading
individually. File by file. Guess how happy I was during doing that?

Second surprise is when I realized that the offline mode is only
sensible for people who want to read documents in Dropbox itself.
Dropbox comes with a built-in PDF which is fairly limited, and since I
can't make it work in pages mode (scroll to swap a page), I wanted to
read my PDFs in Acrobat Reader. This isn't supported, since Acrobat.
Reader states the file is unavailable. There's no way to send the file
to Acrobat Reader from within Dropbox. When I share the document with
AR, the network connectivity is prohibited.

So that's a double bummer. Seems like I need to figure out a way to just
sync files from Dropbox on the shared file system within iOS and later
pointer Acrobat Reader to this location. Am I expecting too much?
