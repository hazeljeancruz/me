Haven't spent too much time reading anything from outside of the business
world lately, but decided to break the bad habit. I picked "Long Walk To
Freedom", since it was present on "50 success classics" which somehow showed
up on my list.

Pretty impressive story of Mandela's life and his presence in South Africa.

Other day friend of mine Jonathan had said 50cent has been shot 9 times, and
is an donor to charity. Don't get me wrong -- Jonathan is as far from being
a genius as I am, however he also asked crucial questions: "What can put a
guy who was shot 9 times down? What are you going to tell him to make him
scared?"

Similar feeling I had after reading this Mandela's autobiography. Being
locked down and incarcerated several times, having spent 27 years in prison,
and being able to celebrate his freedom at the age of 71, he can be
considered a true Made Man of the Africa.

Highly recommended for anybody.
