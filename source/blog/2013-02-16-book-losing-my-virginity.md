Yet another WOW on my list. Absolute MUST to read for anybody interested in
business. Once of the examples that real entrepreneurs can be born outside
of the US, with no "from a shine-box to a millionaire" approach.

However Branson can be called Englishman with the American "dream story".

From a dyslectic schoolboy, who happened to be very unsuccessful due to his
eye problems, through the story of figuring out "Student" magazine can
actually be successful, to all sort of spy-alike threads of his life.

This book reminded me several other people who I've read about: Howard
Jonas, since Branson's and Jonas' ideas were similar--quite original and
very similar. Next Branson's story is very similar to Jim Clark's of Silicon
Valley/Netscape Hall of Fame, since they both struggled with an ordinary
educational system at the beginning of their lives, to finally strive later.
And Jack Welch, since lots of the contents of his "GE memoires" and Branson
story treat about planes.

What I really like is that it's  a very detailed sketch of author's life,
coming straight from his diaries. Also, the range of subjects touched make
this book an interdisciplinary study.

Want to know how to start selling Christmas trees? How to buy a building? Or
take a couple million dollar loan? Rent a jet? This book is for you.

HIGHLY recommended.
