Even if you don't like Windows, some tools there were great. One of them was
WinAmp, probably the best audio player around. (do you know a replacement
for OSX? Let me know!)

Another was Total Commander--the 2 pane file commander. Total commander
could do anything for file management. Its UI is like Norton Commander, the
"blue background" file manager for DOS.

I missed this functionality for OSX. Even through I like "Preview" and
Finder's "color tagging" feature for files (right click on a file -- you can
tag it with color), for shuffling files it's terrible.

So I started from Wikipedia, and learned about "Orthodox File Managers".

The idea is that on the left you have one directory, on the right you have
another one, and you have a set of shortcuts for shuffling files back and
forth. You can copy, move, rename, delete files. In a good manager the
source/destination can be anything: another folder, another computer in the
network, a website server etc.

So what's there for OSX?

This is a great thread, a real gem for OSX:

I've tried some of this stuff, but muCommander beat them all:

Looks simple, but is pretty powerful. You should start playing with it and I
think you'll like it. I like it too.
