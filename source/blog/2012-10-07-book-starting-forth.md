One of the technical classics, which I have promised myself to read.

This book is about concepts of Forth programming and underlying stack
machines.

If you have ever wondered how early chips could still achieve speed and
perform complex tasks with extremely tight memory limits, this book is for
you.

Also, this book serves like a nice introduction to the stack concepts.
If you've ever wondered how PUSH, POP and couple of others can get glued
together to serve useful functions, you'll find it here.
