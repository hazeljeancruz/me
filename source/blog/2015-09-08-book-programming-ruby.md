Really good book which I've picked up after my exposure to 
[Teach yourself Ruby in 21 days](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2014/11/24/book-teach-yourself-ruby-in-21days/)

The accompanying the book is the archive of 1600+ examples in the source
code form, which I've written about here:

[http://www.koszek.com/blog/2015/09/01/the-single-biggest-collection-of-ruby-scripts/](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2015/09/01/the-single-biggest-collection-of-ruby-scripts/)

Worth to note: 50% of this book is API reference. Initially I didn't like
that, but now I feel like it'd be a good opportunity to go and create some
Anki sets from this reference for further revising.
