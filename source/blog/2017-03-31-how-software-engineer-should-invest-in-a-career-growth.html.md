This post is for people who look for ways to spend money on personal growth,
as a software engineer and a person.
Previously I covered [how much one should spend to grow](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/02/06/how-much-software-engineer-should-invest-in-career-growth/).
Here let's talk about some of the best resources you can invest in.
You should seek for ways of saving your money and after-tax earnings.  
Before you apply any of the suggestions, remember to ask your school or
employer about this.
They have a way to bring resources to you, because funds for training and
growth are specially allocated in big institutions. Let's start from the
cheapest to the most expensive.

## Books

**Price:** `$1`--`$100`

**Risk:** `low`

**Benefit:** `high`

Books are pretty cheap, assuming you understand what you're
getting for the price. Lets take the $40 book, for example. 
If you live in the US, you have the natural perspective on what's worth $40;
of what this money can give you. Forty dollars is several coffees and couple
of beagles. Maybe one visit to the cinema with your second half.
Or maybe three lunches, if you eat out.

Yes, I do know forty dollars is a lot of money in most parts of the world.
I'm from Poland originally, and the currency ratio makes $40 be
approximately four times as much.
But by buying books you buy yourself a levarage against all the people who
you meet, interviews you take and all the business opportunities.

Let me give you an example here.  
I remember paying $70 for a fourth edition of [Computer Organization and
Design](http://amzn.to/2nTRxik). It was around 320PLN (Polish Zloty), amount
equal to my monthly stipend from my school's dean. When I told my friends I got a book for 320PLN,
they couldn't believe it. "Why don't you just torrent it?", "Why don't you
just print it?" They didn't know you can buy a book for this much.

This book let me to axe an interview for a [Xilinx](https://www.xilinx.com) internship couple of years
later. I'm highly confident I wouldn't have had enough computer
architecture/Verilog/C fu to pass it without studying from this book.

My intern's salary made the return on investment
for this book alone be somewhere between 100x and 1000x.

Taken into perspective, is $40--$70 book still expensive?

If you want to learn how to make good book picks, you can take a look at my
[Reading 101 for software engineers](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/01/17/reading-for-software-engineers/)
Previously I talked about looking at your learning as a business, and
it's inenvitable to make mistakes on your R&D budget.

## Library membership

**Price:** `$0`--`$500`

**Risk:** `low`

**Benefit:** `high`

Libraries are great. I still can't believe libraries exist and are free.
Use the library to read, study and proof-read books and do work.

In the US libraries come with several perks. For example [Safari Books Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com)
is available at no cost for you.  Some libraries have programs for
audiobooks too such as [OneDigital](https://www.onedigital.com) and [OverDrive](https://www.overdrive.com).  You can "borrow" an
audiobook for two weeks, listen to it, and then "return" it.  It simply
disappears from your device after these two weeks.  Cost is similar: zero.

Libraries are probably the cheapest coworking spaces out there.
When I'm sick of being at home and need more focus and motivation, I'd go to
the library.

Many books aren't great. Library helps with those; no need to buy them, if
you only like one chapter.  Three week lease term is fine because it brings
focus and motivation ("Need to finish this book first to be able to get the
next one")

University libraries prioritize students. For a normal civil it's $80/3 months or $200/year to be able to just enter the library, sit and read. It can be as much as $500/yr to be able to borrow books.

Kindle isn't great for technical stuff, but you can also borrow Kindle books.
Graphics and diagrams looks bad on Kindle.
No more comment here: I have yet to see a decent computer title to look
decent on a Kindle.

## Magazines, journals

**Price:** `$10`--`$40`

**Risk:** `low`

**Benefit:** `medium`

Magazines and journals have a function of keeping you in touch with science
and the industry. It's less of a solid block of knowledge, and more about
juicy pieces you may have not heard about yet.

There are good "popular" tech magazines nowadays, I'm sure, but I just don't
know any. I saw several issues of [Code](http://www.codemag.com/Magazine)
and it was decent. I may subscribe to it.

Around twelve years ago I used to spend quite a bit on ["Software 2.0"](http://sdjournal.pl) magazine (now it's called Software Developer's Journal) and [Linux Plus](http://www.linux-magazine.pl) (now: Linux Magazine). They cost
30PLN in Poland (around $10). They were "extremely expensive newspapers" as
my parents referred to them. One special edition of SDJ was titled "BSD systems"
introduced me to FreeBSD, which changed my life. I still have this edition
of a magazine. One day, I'll frame it.
So yes, magazines can have an impact on your career. Don't feel bad if you buy them.

If you have scientific interests, there are plenty of good journals.
Just visit [ACM](http://www.acm.org) and [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org).
You'll have to become a member to get them, and I think it might be worth it, if that's
your thing.

ACM is $99/year, which isn't bad.
I'm an ACM member. I like their [ACM Queue](http://queue.acm.org). 
It's $8.25/month for a printed version of the magazine, which isn't bad.
You get free Safari Books Online access, and some additional perks.
In fact I joined an ACM because of the conference discounts they offer to
members.

IEEE has [Computing Edge](https://www.computer.org/web/computingedge) magazine, but I never fell in love with it.
IEEE is also expensive: $200/year.
Future of my IEEE is unclear, since the benefits are actually duplicated
with ACM. Being a member of both doesn't give you much.
Let me know what's your IEEE membership reasoning.

[USENIX](https://www.usenix.org) looks great.  I'm thinking of becoming a member of USENIX.
UNIX systems and software systems are my major interests though.
If that's not your cup of tea, maybe evaluate this before.
Their [USENIX ;login](https://www.usenix.org/publications/login) magazine looks great.
I'd subscribe just to get it in a printed version.

## Online classes

**Price:** `$1`--`$200`

**Risk:** `medium`

**Benefit:** `high`

Online learning is really appealing. Having an expert in the field introduce
you to difficult topics is very convenient. What I like is an ability to
stop, rewind, watch the same difficult piece several times. To me it's very
valuable and the real live lecture doesn't offer that. What online class
doesn't provide the ability to interact with other students and having a
discussion, but I believe online learning is getting there.

Online classes are probably the second cheapest after books to benefit
from. They cost anything from $0.99 (for 3-month [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com) account)
through $29/month for [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com) and [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) up to $200/month for
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com).
Authors and companies try to compete to make their name in the
educatino industry. That's how you get a great content for little money.

To people who wonder why it's worth to buy a training instead of watching
YouTube videos I need to answer: "you get what you pay for".
At least that's my experience, and while I think there are some great
resources ([iOS class from Stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/)), you shouldn't
feel bad about spending on online education.

## Boot camps

**Price:** `$2000`--`$20000`

**Risk:** `medium`

**Benefit:** `medium`

I never participated in a boot camp.
The idea you can start from zero, go to a twelve week bootcamp and get some
knowledge to get you started sounds fine.
The idea of getting a job afterwards sounds a little bit unrealistic.
You should study first, so that you're not a total newbie by the time you
go to the bootcamp.
Them do it, and afterwards try to do as many projects on your own as
possible.

## Meetups

**Price:** `$0`--`$80`

**Risk:** `low`

**Benefit:** `low`

[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com) is where interest groups are organized. **Example:** People who program in C++
will have a monthly or bi-weekly meeting scheduled. You can come, interact
with people.

My first contact with Meetup was a [Silicon Valley Forth Interest Group](http://www.forth.org/svfig/). It was great.
Organized every month at Stanford, was very well prepared, with speakers
every time, group discussion. Everybody was a Forth expert with many years
of experience. I loved it.

Most meetups aren't well organized. People come to eat and drink for free
(sometimes organizers are bigger companies, and they flash perks in front of
you). Then they sit. Speaker, who is there just to be able to list his/her
presence on the meetup flashes slides quickly. And then there's the end.
Little interaction, little discussion. This is a mistake in my opinion, and
you should refrain from those. It's a waste of your time. Go to the library
and read a book for two hours. You'll benefit more.

# Conferences

**Price:** `$0`--`$5000`

**Risk:** `medium`

**Benefit:** `medium`

Conferences are good, if you know what you get out of them.
To me, it's more about networking with people; talking to others from the
same field, learning what they use to solve problems which you have as well.
It's less of a solid knowledge transfer.

Scientific conferences are where the real fun is. You have academics
competing with each other for attention from professors and PhDs. Everything
is peer reviewed, and afterwards you're being judged. This makes scientific
conferences to be great. You go there and see that people actually *work*
and *learn*. Unfortunately these aren't common, and you have to be a part of
the circle: do a PhD, be a student or a professor. Focus is narrow, so you
may end up not understanding anything.

Technical conferences are good if you want to understand what the top
of your field is doing, and what direction you should take for your career.
You meet with other people who paid their own money for the conference
(typically several hundred dollars), paid for the flight and a hotel. It's
good in the sense it's, in theory, all people who do the same. You can
brainstorm.

Picking a good conference is hard. You'll have to burn some patience and
study reviews before you go to any. Unless you want to waste your time.

It gets worse for commercial conferences. People will try to recruit you. To
sell you something. To get your e-mail and subscribe you to their mailing
list. Once you get your badge scanned, and your e-mail stolen, you'll be
unable to unsubscribe from all the lists you'll become a part of. If you
reveal your mailing address, they'll be sending you offers and invited for
expensive classes.

On those, you get employees of the companies are participants.
They didn't pay anything--they were sent there, sometimes against their
will, by their companies.
Or they volunteered to have a day free of work.
They're there to have fun, not to learn.
You will talk to some people from the industry, and it's fun.
You'll get some LinkedIn contacts.
But that's it.
It's a waste of time.

## College classes

**Price:** `$300`--`$100,000`

**Risk:** `high`

**Benefit:** `high`

College is good if you like structured study program.
If you're a student already, don't resign from college, as long as you're
able to afford it.
Pick good, difficult classes about topics which are hard to learn.
Examples: operating systems, networking, compilers.

Some countries make colleges accessible and free.
In Poland you could drop in to the class, sit and listen.
No need to be a registered student.
Normally you wouldn't get kicked out, unless there isn't enough sits.
Some, like the US, have colleges that are very expensive.
I don't know if you can drop-in for a class.

One unit of a class in the US can be $1300 dollars, so three-unit class is around $4k.
Being able to say you've graduated from a Stanford or Berkeley class has
some charm. This is one of the things which are hard to quantify.
It's possible that your future employer will scan your resume, Stanford name
will stand out, so you'll get the call.

Practically, it's hard to say if this happens. For sure you can get the same
amount of knowledge cheaper. It's likely it'll take longer to assimilate the
knowledge, but you'll get there.

## Summary

My attempt was to help you understand where the biggest benefit is.
With books and online classes, you'll get the biggest kick for your money.
In terms of the rest of the ways to learn, it all depends on your
conditions.
Let me know if I missed anything. I'd like to pick up some of your ideas for
learning.
