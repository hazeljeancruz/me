Publishing content in the Internet is easy. Sharing is easy too if you want
your friends and family to access it. It's hard to deliver the content to
people who you don't know. Why would anyone read your post? You don't read

give a darn about you. Maybe unless you give them a cigarette.

Making content today is like making a luxury candy. It must look
outstanding, smell great and be immediately useful. And then you're an
obedient servant who delivers is to the doorstep of your readers.
