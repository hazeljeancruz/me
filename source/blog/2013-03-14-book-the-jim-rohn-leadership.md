By all means this is a great content, which I can highly recommend. Rohn is
an excellent speaker; very easily to listen and understand. Everything
taught came from relatively recent materials, thus thing heard from this
audiobook are likely to be easily understood by you and your kid.

Rohn has a very similar speaking style to Zig Ziglar -- along the main
motivational content and success "preachings", he mentions his influences
from religion and God. He also jokes quite a bit, and unlike other people,
he uses pretty strong sense of humor -- nearly Polish.

The cool stuff about this recording is that all masters joined each other on
stage together. So this is Jim Rohn as a host plus .... Zig Ziglar, Denis
Waitley and .... Brian Tracy. Truly exceptional dream team. Funny thing is
that Tracy comes from the generation of "American dream" millionaires--I
wasn't aware of that. Have to study some more from the books written by this
gentleman.

My brain gets overflowed by this kind of content however. I speculate I just
need a vacation from motivational content. For now all I hear makes me feel
"I listened to this stuff already", thus I'm less receptive to things being
said..

At least I somehow woke up on jokes.

Even though that tired with this flavor, I can easily make a statement that
listening of this stuff was a very positive experience. Highly recommended.
