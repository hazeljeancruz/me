Successful duet of Ries and Trout deliver another content together 2nd time in a row.

I do agree with other people whom I have discussed this book with: examples
mentioned can be questionable. Basically it looks they wanted to confirm their
theories with practice by giving examples, but the way it's done makes you
feel like: "Oh gosh. If I wanted, I could provide 100 different counter
examples".

Marketing is more like a "social engineering", or "psychological
engineering", and I believe failures of products and companies mentioned
here weren't entirely due to what authors mentioned--failure to comply with
one of the 22 laws.

Just like success teachers following Napoleon Hill wanted to state "The Law
of Success" is a one of the next nature's law, Ries and Trout want to saw
laws of marketing are a fixed rules which are better to be followed. Well..
I think these are good advices, but don't think this book will give you 100%
successful strategy for marketing.

This is basically a good book with lots of do's and dont's when you're just
about to start figuring out (or fixing) what you've done.

The whole thing isn't backed by numbers or studies. The book has no
biography.  So treat it as "good to read" as an inspiration, but be careful
and expect everything can end up 100% different than expected.

World is just too many factors..
