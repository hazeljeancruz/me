title:	"More Joel on Software"
author: "Wojciech Adam Koszek"
abstract: >
  The "Joel on Software" book and his blog made me order this follow-up.
  If you read this now or maybe see my other review of "Joel on Software"
  writings, I think you'll be fine ordering this position too. It's
  basically a printed collection of posts you'd find on Joel's website for free.

No worse than the predecessor, this book is a mandatory item for everybody
related to the hi-tech world in any way.

You'll find hints, tips&tricks and dark secrets in the areas of hiring,
project management, software engineering as well as marketing and selling
your products.

Highly recommended.
