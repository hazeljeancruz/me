I was born in 1987 in Czestochowa, Poland.
I graduated in 2011 with MSc in Computer Science and Engineering degree from
[Czestochowa University of Technology](http://www.pcz.pl/en/).

My first experience I got from using
[FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org) and installing it wherver I could.
I had eleven customers, run several local area networks with shared Internet,
and administered [my highschool](http://www.norwid.net) FreeBSD server.

This resulted in many bug fixes and submissions to the FreeBSD repository.
I became a FreeBSD developer around 2006, where I was active for several
years, working on kernel/userspace bug fixes.

During my studies I worked part-time at
[Czestochowa Metropolitan Area Network (CzestMAN)](http://k2.pcz.czest.pl),
and took many internships in
[Poznan Supercomputer and Networking Center](http://www.man.poznan.pl/online/en/),
[Center for Computation & Technology, Louisiana](https://www.cct.lsu.edu),
[Ericsson Nomadic Lab](https://www.ericsson.com/fi),
and [HIIT](https://www.hiit.fi) (Helsinki, Finland) and
[Xilinx](http://www.xilinx.com) (San Jose, CA).

Xilinx re-hired me full-time in 2011. I worked on an operating system for
randomized stress testing of ARM and ARM64 CPUs, and later, on Single-Event
Upset characterization. Since then I've moved up in the software ladder and worked at
[Twin&nbsp;Prime](http://www.twinprime.com) where we've built a technology for
mobile Internet acceleration.

I live and work in Bay Area, CA.
