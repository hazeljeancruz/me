Hello,

I have four articles for you:

- [Great Movies About Design](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/06/05/great-movies-about-design/) where I listed interesting documentary movies about design which helped me expand my design and usability knowledge.

- [Hackers and Cooks: how building software really feels like](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/06/26/hackers-and-cooks/) in which I shared my analogy between cooking and building software products.

- [To actually ship software, add constraints](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/06/28/to-actually-ship-software-add-constraints/) in which I shared my view on shipping software for yourself.

- [Don't Kid Yourself About Software Bootcamps](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/06/30/dont-kid-yourself-about-coding-bootcamps/) in which I shared my honest and brutal truth about bootcamps

This month I read two great books. First is for you if you're interested
into investments and how companies work [A Random Walk Down Wall
Street](http://amzn.to/2tJFZEj).  It's great and written in a language easy
to understand, and I can highly encuorage you to just page through it.

Second one is for entrepreneurial types. Title is [Who Says Elephants Can't
Dance](http://amzn.to/2tGySNg) and it's a first-person take on
transformation of IBM during its '90 crisis.

As always I'm interested in your thoughts and suggestions.

That's all for now. Take care and see you in a month.
