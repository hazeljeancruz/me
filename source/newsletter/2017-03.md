Howdy..

..April 1st!

This March I've split between 75% building new code, and 25% writing. I published four articles:

- [How to use Ansible Vault with LastPass](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/03/05/how-to-use-ansible-vault-with-lastpass/) in which you'll learn how to use a password manager LastPass to manage secrets stored in the Ansible Vault

- [Movies every software engineer should watch](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/03/13/movies-every-software-engineer-should-watch/) where you get to know movies which have some bits and pieces of the techy culture and which I enjoyed and you'll too

- [Are you a good Open Source contributor?](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/03/28/are-you-a-good-open-source-contributor/) which shows the scale of Open Source contributors and tells you how to get better at publishing code; everything by doing a series of little steps

- [How software engineer should invest in career growth](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/03/31/how-software-engineer-should-invest-in-career-growth/) where I show the best ways to invest money into your software engineering education

Let me know if you know any other good techy movies, or if you learn/study in a ways which I didn't cover.

**I need testers!**

I've made the tool mentioned in the 1st article:
[https://github.com/wkoszek/lastpass-ansible](https://github.com/wkoszek/lastpass-ansible).

Ruby packages for Ubuntu is something I've spent 4 nights on. If you develop with Ruby
on remote machines, you may check this out: [https://github.com/wkoszek/ruby_packages](https://github.com/wkoszek/ruby_packages) This is the latest Ruby built as `.deb` package.


I'm also working on a small but secret project of mine. Will connect writing software, design, typography and publishing. If interested, shoot my an e-mail and I'll add you to an early bird list.

That's all for now. Take care and see you in a month.
