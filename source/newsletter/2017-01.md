Hello,

A while ago you subscribed to my mailing list. Maybe you liked one of the
articles I've written on [my website](http://www.koszek.com)?  For 2017 I
plan to give you regular monthly updates to keep myself accountable. That's
right--one e-mail a month. That's all. But you don't have this limit. You
can e-mail me more times, with questions and suggestions, and the most
important: your criticism.

This January I wrote four articles and I believe you may find them
interesting:

- [That's why you haven't accomplished enough in 2016](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/01/02/thats-why-you-havent-accomplished-enough-in-2016/)
  has my ideas on goal settings and shows two books which helped me a lot
  with productivity. To write my blog, for example, I'm trying to build a
  habit of writing every day.

- [Reading 101 for software engineers](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/01/17/reading-for-software-engineers/)
  gives you hints on how to filter good technical content. I don't like new
  books on software engineering, and I argue you should mostly focus on
  long-lasting topics that don't change much.

- [The best OSX file manager](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/01/18/the-best-osx-file-manager/)
  will be useful only if you have an Apple Mac computer. It talks about
  muCommander--the tool which increased my productivity.

- [Why you should start programming on UNIX](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/01/28/why-you-should-start-programming-on-unix/)
  explains why I believe that using UNIX (building block of OSX and Linux)
  to start programming and I argue other domains of programming are harder
  to get into.

I'd like to encourage you to subscribe to [my YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/wkoszek) I just started. It will be
about software and technical topics. The most relevant videos so far are:
[Building an Open Source iOS app, part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6YDXyF6ks&t=726s) and
[Building an Open Source iOS app, part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE49zGSFcio&t=46s).
This is one, very long talk, I know. I went over time. But the feedback was positive, and I
made new professional connections.

Let me know what you think and feel free to re-connect and let me know what
you're up to.

Take care and see you in a month.
