Hello,

May is around, and I'm writing to you from New Heaven, CT where I'm spending
a weekend. But I still have four articles for you:

- [Treat Continuous Integration as your virtual user](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/05/07/treat-ci-as-a-virtual-user/) where I explained why I think you may be wasting your users time by using Continuous Integration incorrectly and how to fix it

- [What it's like to write software in the hardware industry](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/05/13/what-i-learned-from-writing-software-in-hardware-industry/) where I explained why it might be a good idea to get some experience in the hardware industry as a software engineer

- [15 Tips on Staying Productive Offline as a Software Engineer](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/05/22/15-tips-on-staying-productive-offline-as-a-software-engineer/) In which I explained which tools to use for productive software work offline. This should be especially useful to you if you find yourself often doing ... other things.

- [Which Open Source Projects Should You Contribute To](https://www.koszek.com/blog/2017/05/31/which-open-source-projects-should-you-contribute-to/) In which I talked about how to go about choosing which Open Source projects are worth contributing to.

On the side note I read two really good books. First one
[The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success](http://amzn.to/2sobBfE)
those title speak for itself, and 
[The Lean Startup](http://amzn.to/2s3IMrw) which talks a lot about MVPs,
agile and testing.  I highly recommend both of them if you're interested in entrepreneurship.

As always I'm interested in your thoughts and suggestions.

That's all for now. Take care and see you in a month.
