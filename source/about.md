I was born in 1987 in Czestochowa, Poland.
I graduated in 2011 with MSc in Computer Science and Engineering degree from
Czestochowa University of Technology.
My experience I gained from work at Czestochowa Metropolitan Area Network
(CzestMAN) and internships (Poznan Supercomputer and Networking Center),
Center for Computation & Technology (LA, USA), Ericsson and HIIT (Helsinki,
Finland) and Xilinx (San Jose, CA).

Since 2011 I live and work in Bay Area, CA.
