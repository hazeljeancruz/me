Playing drums is about snare drum technique. This high-pitched, 
drum sits in front of you, is tense, loud as hell, and makes your sticks
bounce. To master drums, you pick a book and follow it, by executing
series of left and right hits, in dozens of different combinations. Unless
you have fun and really enjoy it, I doubt you can be a good drummer. There's
just no way. It's too plain boring.

Software is the same. As a matter of fact, any complex skill is, but lets
focus on software. Unless you want and enjoy it, you'll fail, I can tell you
this now. If you start playing with software and you feel extreme boredom
and pain, it's just not for you. So just stop.

The feeling out of learning to write programs is similar to when you throw
puzzles on your table. Or LEGO. Or lay out chess. You have this curious tension and
you're ready to start playing with it. You know it'll take a while and have
many obstacles, but you still want to do it.

That's how you should approach software.



is tense and all you do all they 
When I first started 

You must leave some space in your mind for leasure time.
This is where your brain muscle will relax, and will start making random
associations, similar to those when you doze off, chill, on the pillow
during your power nap.
