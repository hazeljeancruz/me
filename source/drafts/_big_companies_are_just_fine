Working for big company is just fine.
If you are a new grad and you oscillate between work for yourself, a startup
and a big company and a gut feeling tells you big company may be right
choice, don't struggle.
It probably is.
Common pattern within Silicon Valley and hacker community is to bash big companies,
but I think these people are wrong.
A lot of them are idealistic, and

Big company reflects more about how to think about big problems.
The solutions in a big corportation are designed to scale.
If you file a form, it's because someone somewhere in a deep corporate
machine figured out a process for your problem.

It's slow and frustrating, but you must understand that what big company is
facing is growth. Same big, old, highly desired for every startup. Growth.

I'm no different, and when I need to file a form in a corporate system and
wait several days for a reply--this process is frustrating.

The real problem happens when you don't fit.
For example at my previous job it was problematic 

comes with

in here I'd like to make people understand why it makes little sense to do
so.

Bashing big company is kind of like bashing a big country. When I hear
people bitching about "Big bu" the feeling I get is parallel to complaints I
hear about socialism and communism in China. I'm no expert in policy and
economics, but you don't need to be Adam Smith to understand China is big,
and is facing problems which countries 3 times as small (like the US) may
not face similar issues.

I have found this is not the case.
Learning in a big company does happen.
