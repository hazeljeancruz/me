Amazing take on a lean approach of business management. I didn't believe
it'll be a valuable book, but boy.. was I wrong!
Excellent position. Similar to Toyota concepts, but with so much better
storyline.

Author grabbed the agile practices and wrapped them in a
fictional storyline in a way that made it actually a very interesting
fiction book. 

Reads like a novel, and touches some social aspects of the management.

More dynamic work schedules, smaller batches, less inventory. Removal of
bottlenecks, definition of success in business. Calculations of efficiency
and business. Meaning of automation (robots on production line). Continuous
improvement.

If you've read [The Toyota Way](https://www.koszek.com/books/2012/04/04/book-the-toyota-way/)
recently you may not learn lots of new
things, however this book is really worth reading because of the ease of
transferring knowledge. Compared to "The Toyota Way", this books reads
really lightly.

HIGHLY recommended.
