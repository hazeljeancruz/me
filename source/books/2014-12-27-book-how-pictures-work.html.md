This little great book is a perfect night read: little words. If present,
they're very condensed, filled only with very rich content. But words is not
why this book is great: its illustrative graphics helps you understand why
pictures work how they work. And why.

Book is made up from a story, which starts with the page number one and
builds till the very last page. Each page contains a sample image with short
explanation and gives the reader a moment to look at the image and figure
out how it feels.

If you've ever wondered how good designers distinguish certain moods out of
the graphical content, this read is for you. Relax, tension, balance,
disproportion are all explained in this book. Plus there's a great exercise
at the end!
