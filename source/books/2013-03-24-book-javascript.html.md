1/3rd of book is good. The rest was basically API manual pages all over the
place and DOM browser hierarchies explained. I skipped those.

1/3rd I went through was decent. Javascript is like C, but slightly more
extended.

Unless you buy stuff from used book outlets via Amazon I don't recommend.
Other than that: $4 well spent.
