If you want to make software products, you must know design. Even when I
worked for the hardware company, my software was used by humans, and they
object if what you make sucks. I've made a script used by many engineers for
result reporting. And the output was shared in the web, PDF and printed
form. For stuff like this you must know design, otherwise you'll fail
miserably. 

This is one of the few books for hackers to introduce you to design step by
step. The amount of unnecessary fluff is minimal. It uses easy language,
without many scientific details which you'd forget anyway.

The examples are nice and clear.

Exercises are fun and doable. I often find examples a drudgery, but for this
book it wasn't a case.

You get to learn simple rules. Rules, which you can put on your checklist
and which are easy to memorise. You can actually think of them when making
your next visual software.

While I know the importance of design, typography, layout and grid already
before reading this book, color was something I struggled with. After
reading this book the sense, meaning and composition of colored elements in
your software should be easier.

I'm by no means good with it, but I understand where to use what better.
The app or website must look good and be fairly appealing to people for them
to stick to it. If it sucks, people won't even look around. If you're into
building products for other people, this book will show you how to use
typography, size, alignment, repetition and contrast to make your creations
usable.

Basically, can't recommend this book highly enough.
