This time Joel acted as a art connoisseur, who picked the best miniature art
forms and glued them together and commented on.

Ken Arnold's "Style is substance" has so many good ideas, that I felt like I
could have written this chapter myself (joking -- I just really always
wanted to have C-like-Python, where C code would preserve it's syntax, but
there "\t" and " " wouldn't be neutral).

Raymond's Chen "Why not to block apps that rely on undocumented behavior"
pushed me to get back to his Microsoft blog and ordering his book "The Old
New Thing".

``ea_spouse`` gave an explanation why Electronic Arts people sometimes look
older than other people in the same age.

Graham's "Great Hackers" old proved that he'll be the next person whose
writings (besides "Hackers and painters" I'll have to explore)

"MacWorld 6.0" sounded like a real software engineering story, which I
enjoyed reading about.

All these essays are an excellent reading. I don't really know how Joel
picked these people, but I think thanks to his excellent writing style, he
just created "Writers circle".

Really good piece of writing. Highly recommended.
