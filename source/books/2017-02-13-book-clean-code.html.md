This book is a classic for books about writing software, but in general I
found it underwhelming. Java code is verbose by default, with all its
`public`, `static`, `protected` even refactored, you end up with a similar
level of complexity. That's the take I had from that book: several examples
were indeed refactored and the end code was shown, but I had "meh" feeling
about whether it really helped the program readability.

The "Code Complete" is waaay better.

If I were to recommend you a code quality book, the "Code Complete" would be
it. I might be biased. If Java is your technology of choice, read "Clean
Code" as well.
