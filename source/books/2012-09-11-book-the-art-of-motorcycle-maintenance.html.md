  Not ready to review it yet, I guess. This is a deep book, with a lot
  of dual meanings of things, and this book is not the best choice for an
  audiobook..

Being over-ambitious is the worst of all sin. I promised myself to seek for
recommendations for good books and stick to them and listen to nobody's
rules and consume books one at a time. I forced myself to not switch between
book to book, even though book doesn't seem to be a perfect match with my
interests right away.

Most of the books which got recommended to me were very interesting.
However, listening through "Zen and Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" was like
a walk through hell, specially that in one third of the book I just couldn't
understand who the Phaedrus is. Even though pretty obvious to some, I just
didn't grasp it first time.

I regret what I've done next -- I cheated.  I went and learned more about
Pirsig from the Internet.  His biography and history was pretty depressing.
Still, however, I kept going through the book as I was walking in a dark
room without expecting too much.

I started writing this article just after I read the book. I wanted to start
it with "I went through the terrible pain lately", since the book didn't
"feel" comfortable, as I was reading it. However I decided to postpone the
review notes and come back to it after some time.

Now, couple of weeks later, the experience on the book feels much, much
better somehow. I look at our dripping kitchen and bathroom sink differently
now.

I'm actually surprised how little connection between deeper levels of
technical craft and the real-life activities for mere mortals there were.
Most of things mentioned were actually not quite technical. True, science
was mentioned often. True, psychology showed up. But I expected book of
different sort. Basically now that I think about the book I think:
psychology.

Lastly, the after-word of the book adds more to the specific understanding
of Pirsig, and I keep coming back to the story quite often.  This is how I
can conclude that this book made an impact on me. Especially the fact that,
after all, Pirsig kept going.
