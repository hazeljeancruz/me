This is a biography of David Ogilvy of Ogilvy and Mather.

You will get a behind the scenes look at the advertising agency and
business, but you won't get much of advises about advertising of how to
write a good body copy.

For this, look at other books by the same author.

I decided to read this book, since I was intrigued by Ogilvy, since it
appears he did his homework on measuring the efficiency of ads like no one
else, and I wanted to understand how much of what I see in the Internet is a
well-measured manipulation, researched or a random spam.

This is a very well written book, with a lot of research and a great deal of
funny anecdotes. If you're interested in learning more about how companies
promote their products and why, this book is great.
