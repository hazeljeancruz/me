title:	"Innovate like Edison"
author: "Wojciech Adam Koszek"
abstract: >
  Funny. This book shows Edison like a true grand master of innovation.
  I guess it's well deserved, yet a lot of people know that Tesla was
  invention hero. Ready this book, but read something on Tesla too.

Great introduction to the life and achievements of one of the most famous
inventors ever lived.

Backstage view on Edison life and his enterprise operation is shown in this
book: ideas and inventions, entrepreneurial approach to things and business
dealings show Edison not only as a scientist, but as a great business
leader.

Very good review on how operation of the first R&D laboratory looked like.

Authors tries to give systematic approach of innovation, but I don't really
believe that. I view the book as a collection of "good to have" advices.

They mention lots of Edison's things that were just his thing, and which are
so different in between entrepreneurs that it's hard to tell whether
Edison's "unique features" really helped him to be so successful.

There's a big cross-section with Napoleon Hill's classic here, which authors
emphasize several times. This only proves how big of a art piece Hill's book
is.

To balance the feelings after this book, I suspect I'll have to pick
something about Tesla's life.

Anyway - really enjoyed listening to it.
