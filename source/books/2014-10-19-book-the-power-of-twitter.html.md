For some time now I was promising myself that I'd try to put social media under
my control, since thanks to many website I use on a daily basis I realized
communication is a good thing. Twitter usage has been hard to understand to
myself, as I came from a UNIX culture of hardcore engineers no interested in
non-Terminal, non-black-and-white things.
