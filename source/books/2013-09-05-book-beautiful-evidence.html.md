  Similar to "Envisioning information". I'd have to re-read these books once

  be very similar.

"Beautiful evidence" is similar to "Envisioning information" and felt
similar in terms of style of writing, as well as the content itself. The
books is good to go through.

Not sure if it's me only or it's the true in general, but once again I've
found Tufte's comments pretty hard to understand due to his language used.
It's very professorial and overly complex, thus making the content sometimes
hard to understand.

The last chapter showing the stands for the sculpture statues I've found
especially interesting -- this was a pure artistic view on sometimes I
haven't been paying attention to. It showed me how the true designers looks
at thing. Very informative.

This book is great because of the graphical content. The textual
explanations are harder to get, yet I feel but just looking at pictures and
reading descriptions briefly you can learn new stuff.

Content was different to "Envisioning information", so the recommendation is
similar: worth to read for any book and graphic designs and everybody who
has a need to present a content in a accessible manner.
