You created a blog, but it sucks? It has beautiful minimized HTML, great
JavaScript and CSS and renders flawlessly on iOS 6. The problem is that
nobody but you is accessing your blog?

Exactly.

I made [this blog](https://www.koszek.com) in 2012, but didn't really think
about it much. I restarted the efforts in 2015 and 2016, but had moderate
success (hundreds visitors "spiking" when I published something, and then
traffic dying out after 2 days).
That's the moment in publishing online where you think: "Really,
that's all I get by publishing stuff to millions of people?"

That was my motivation. To learn more.
I knew my blog isn't yet very well targeted already, and even though I know
authors like 
[Dan Luu](https://danluu.com)
who report
[very good results](https://danluu.com/blog-ads/)
with general "blog about software" scheme, I feel like I'd gain more from
targeting e.g.: authors interested in building cloud services in Go.

When I saw [Yegor](https://www.yegor256.com) writing a book on
blogging, I decided to sign up as a reviewer. Being reviewer is a very good
deal: you make notes which youâ€™d make anyway, but you are heard by an
author, who may care more than when the book is finished and in print. And
you get a free book of $40 value. 

**General opinion** If you buy this book for $40,
you'll be among 1% of experts who care about the quality of the
content which they produce. People like that like to bounce ideas from
each other, and read books, articles, magazines and then share this
knowledge. Read the book, and share the knowledge with me and others.

**Longer take on a book** You'll learn about modern realities of technical
blogging from Yegor. He is successful with blogging, getting around
2000 visitors a day. I think it's a good number to strive for. It would be
cool to get some screenshots of his audience and the cross-section about who
they are. That would complete the value of the book. Even without more
information on statistics, the book is a good resource.

My experience tells me to be distant to  information which I can't
cross-check.  I'm like an untrustful fox, which was caught in a trap
multiple times.  It's because often authors like to "bump up" their profile
in front of each other, and while I don't know if this touches Yegor too, I
do believe the book would benefit from more factual proofs and information
deep-down into the details of how it actually looks like from the author's
side. *I'm waiting for this in the next edition of the book*

Yegor explains some of his tricks: paid Twitter Ads to get users to subscribe
to his mailing list, and no success with Facebook Ads. 
I think it's fair to use these techniques, if it really works, i.e.: 
if these "subscribers" and visitors
aren't bots and they're real people, then that's fine. Bots are to the
engagement metrics what dead code is to software. It's be good to
understand how much such numbers are skewed.

There are some contradictory pieces in the book, and also a lot of it are
opinions. Since I've been interested in the topic of growing your audience
recently, I've researched some other resources on blogging ([Technical
blogging](http://amzn.to/2lKlRhV) for example, and
[Softskills](http://amzn.to/2lEvM83) before reading
"256 blog hacks". Whichever expert you talk to, they all have slightly
different opinion. Let me skip these differences. The common theme for
success is: niche, regularity, high-quality content, mailing list "digest" sent
out weekly or monthly.

I disagree with Yegor that blogging about software engineering must be done
"technically", with static generator, debugging of HTML and CSS etc. I don't
think people care. The best blogs which I benefited from in my career looked
terrible, in fact. Example: old (pre-2017) version of
[Joel on Software](http://www.JoelOnSoftware.com).
You can read how [Joel struggled](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2016/12/09/rip-citydesk/)
with his original platform.
It was a technical ghetto, had tons
of ads on the right side of the blog. But I grew up on Internet: my mind has
an ad blocker built-in, and Joel's content was great. I kept reading post
after post. I really didn't care whether it's WordPress or Jekyll.
I couldn't care less about his publishing pain and look: content was
outstanding.

Funny is that his experience with proofreaders was exactly the same as mine.
I've worked with two good people and both of them disappeared pretty much in the
same time. The difference I'm doing is that I'm trying to get $5 for 500 words
deals, paying from $10 to $15 per post for English correction. Recently I've
stopped doing this.

Some of the stuff Yegor mentions about writing is actually from
[On Writing Well](https://www.koszek.com/books/2016/01/15/book-on-writing-well/)
so if you want to boost your writing, maybe pick up this book.
Another really great take on writing you can find in Stephen King's [On
writing](https://www.koszek.com/books/2015/10/21/book-on-writing/).
I haven't read any of King's books, but like the guy during interviews on YouTube.

**Summary** You won't regret buying "256 blog hacks" and I feel like it'll
supercharge your blogging. Let me know how it goes.
