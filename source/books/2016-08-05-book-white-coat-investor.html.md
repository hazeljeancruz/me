Would you like to get better with the personal finance?

Who wouldn't right?

You're not alone, if you still think that some things in your wallet happen
by accident. And often you forget and later are surprised.

Many of us are like this, and often getting a good advise of how to change
this stage of things is challenging.

This book could be a remedy. Originally targeted towards doctors, I've found
it very useful as an engineer.  Just smart part of this book is directed
towards medical procession. Most of it is universal.

It's a walk-through the topic of IRA, 401k, 403b's, investing in
real-estate, low-cost index funds and has some general advises on saving
money.

There are numbers and calculations mentioned. This is very good.

What's the best about this book is the author did so much research that the
book seems like a competent and relevant source of knowledge.

I didn't get the part about the backdoor Roth 401k. If you pick this book up
and get to this chapter where it's explained, you can let me know if you've
understood it fully. I'll have to re-read this part of the book after a
short break, I guess.

Just take a look at author's website and the number of references. The
titles seem great and I think I'll try to pick some of other references
positions in the future.
