This book is an excellent take on the strategies of great CEOs.
I don't remember how I learned about it, but I believe it was
[The Snowball](http://amzn.to/2eGXlfJ).

Most of people from this book were fairly unconventional, and against the
per-book approach of management.

Great part of the book is a breakdown of capital allocation and capital
preservation strategies.

Author did an excellent role in researching leaders who previously haven't
been covered in the literature. For example, the Henry Singleton of Teledyne
is pretty mysterious, but his results were pretty impressive.
