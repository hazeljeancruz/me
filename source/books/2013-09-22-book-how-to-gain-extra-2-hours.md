When I first listened to this book, I started to have a bad opinion about Tracy's
books, since the advice which I have heard is basically: "In order to get
more productive and earn 2 additional hours per day is basically show up at
work 1 hour early and leave 1 hour late".

But then is started to slowly make sense -- he suggested making lists with
priorities, a typical technique known for folks who studied from David
Allen's "Getting things done".

Along the other books, this served as a completion of my "Increased
productivity studies". I can recommend it, however if you have listen to
Allen, then lots of information will be replicated.
