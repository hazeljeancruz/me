title:  "The Phoenix Project"
author: "Wojciech Adam Koszek"
abstract: >
  This book was essentiall what "The Toyota Way" showed me, but more in the
  high-tech end. So if you feel like you're just starting up with agile or
  you're not a technical person and you need direct advice wrt. software
  engineering/IT/support for agile, this book is for you. Value and
  storytelling are very well done here. Reminded me: "The Goal".
