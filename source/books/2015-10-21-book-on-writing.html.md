Audiobook format of
["On writing"](http://amzn.to/2mMaaEW)
was excellent.
King read it himself.
This is what I like about audiobook: they make the form be rich and more colorful
by adding this another dimension.
This might be one of the few positions where I can *recommend* the audiobook
over a paper book.

First of all books are great.
I believe you'll have the same while reading or listening to King.

There's a great part about writing as compared to telepathy. This was my
favorite moment in a book. Another one was King's commentary on his own
accident.

King did us a big favor and published his non-fiction piece.
He explained all the inner-workings of the professional, world-class
writer.
One could compare it to Donald Knuth's books, where he explains how he
thinks about the problem.


I'm not a big horror or fiction person. In fact, I find these books hard to
swallow.
You can appreciate the storytelling and all the made up 
as I'm more non-fiction hungry reader, but I really enjoyed it.
My confession: I haven't read any of King's books.

It's partially a autobiography, and partially the suggestion guide. But not
same style as [The Elements of Style](http://amzn.to/2lkwaK4), which I found
valuable, but dry and boring. Listening to "On writing" was a pure pleasure,
since it's entertaining and interesting, and the storyline interleaves the
suggestions and advises.

Second part of the book is mostly a guide for writers. Phrased King's way,
they are more memorable than "20 steps to better writing" or lists like
that.

I wish someone did similar book for non-fiction.
But even for my purposes (technical writing, essays on software) this book
will be very usable.
If you're into blog writing or writing of any kind, buy it. You won't
regret; it will help and inspire your.

**NOTE** I rarely re-listen to stuff on Audible, but I did this for King's
book.
