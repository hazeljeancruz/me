King did us a big favor and published his non-fiction piece. To me it's a
great book.  Not only this, in the audiobook form, he reads the book.  This
is what I like about audiobook: they make the form be rich and more colorful
by adding this another dimension.

There's a great part about writing as compared to telepathy. This was my
favorite moment in a book. Another one was King's commentary on his own
accident.

I'm not a big horror or fiction person. In fact, I find these books hard to
swallow, as I'm more non-fiction hungry reader, but I really enjoyed it.

If you're into blog writing or writing of any kind, buy it. You won't
regret; it will help and inspire your.

**NOTE** I rarely re-listen to stuff on Audible, but I did this for King's
book.
