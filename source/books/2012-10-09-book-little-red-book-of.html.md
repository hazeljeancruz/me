title:	"Little Red Book of Selling: 12.5 Principles of Sales Greatness"
author: "Wojciech Adam Koszek"
abstract: >
  This was the first book on selling that I read. Looking back and reviewing
  it after 4 years I don't remember it much. I should re-read it probably
  because I've read more books by the same author. No strong yes, but not
  definite no.

I didn't like this one at the beginning, since it sounds like a book written
by a salesperson, but ... I forced myself to finish. Conclusion: good study
on sales and selling and marketing.

Then I learned all of his books at least once were on top #1 of Amazon.com,
and...

**I confess**: I went through while "Little book.." series, including "Gold"
and "Green", as well as "Sales bible".

The general message is: as a salesman, you'll have to work your ass off for
being truly successful.

First time I understood a term "cold calling". I do believe this is
hard--based on how assertive my grandmother was, I know there well be people
not willing to spend 5s on listening to you. I'm included in that group.
Selling over the phone wouldn't work for me.

You want to understand how to get pass the secretary and reach the person
who has some decision making power? This book will be for you.

Interestingly, sometimes you can use the concept of "Could you please
connect me to your manager?" phrase and it sometimes works just fine.
However rarely do I use it.

Don't sell things which you don't use yourself.

Sense of humor.

People like to buy, but not being sold

Importance of networking and relationships is emphasized.
