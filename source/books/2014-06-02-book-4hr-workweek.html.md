description: >
  Tim had a very successful company selling suplements, and wrote a book how
  to live once you get wealthy. Many people like this book, but I didn't get
  it. Valuable thing was talking about trying to automate tedious tasks in
  your life and spend your time better. But as far as I remember, the actual
  problems meeting the entrepreneur aren't discussed in this book.
