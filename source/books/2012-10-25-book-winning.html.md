High "OMG" factor for me. Price of the book to knowledge "sold" ratio is
very high here.

General Electric, or maybe rather Edison General Electric, is a result of
successful entrepreneurial skills of Thomas Edison. Given this links to the
whole Hill, Ford, Schwab chain, I just couldn't resist from reading that
one.

Welch, in his 20-year CEO career at GE experienced pretty much all possible
cases of business success/failure. Starting from needing to close
facilities, to drop businesses and stay with only the successful one, to
figuring out solutions in crisis situations.

Book has a significant chunk of US economy history. Mention about "work your
ass off" strategy in old US days is described in the context of "work/life
balance".

Pretty interesting cases are touched, due to the broad scope of GE products.
Anything from home appliances to jet engines.

Development of new jet engine: 10 year effort costing $1B.

Modular MRI--example that 1 successful bright idea can beat great
competitors really quickly.

There's lots of absolute and firm treatment of people, where they're treated
and rewarded very well, when they deliver excellent results.

It felt dry at the beginning, but turned out to be very good and I enjoyed
it a lot.
