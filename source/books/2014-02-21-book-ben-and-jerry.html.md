One of the widely advertised books on bootstrapping of the company. Coming
from nothing to the conclusion that both of the founders want to work
together on something fairly non-standard.

There were several good examples on how these two guys had to adjust to the
business conditions to connects end to end together.

The story of research and development of cookie dough was quite "different"
as I've known little to nothing on the process of ice-cream making before.
Same about business story behind Cherry Garcia Ice Cream.

Not a must; rather a obligatory reading for people interested in biographies
and corporate history.

BTW:

Get on hold of this book was much harder than anything else, since I knew
allocating time would be hard. I ordered **audio tapes**, found a Jack-Jack
audio cable and converted it in Audacity on my FreeBSD laptop.
