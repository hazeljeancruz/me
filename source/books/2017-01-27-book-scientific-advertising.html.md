David Ogilvy and many other authors of copy-written ads mentioned  Claude C.
Hopkins was their hero, and that his book is a mandatory reading. You should
at least look at it, if you want to get a full experience for your
advertising and marketing education.

The myths of advertising being “creative” are debunked here. The advertising
from a purely scientific format is shown. Ads are treated like salesperson,
and the same demands are expected out of them. Bringing money to the table,
and making a sale is what he talked about all the time.

The book mentions an importance of measuring effects of your advertisements.
You measure everything and everywhere. You must remember this it’s written
in 1926, but pretty much everything in this book can be applied in 2017.

Nice thing is that there’s a logical split into 21 chapters. Each chapter
begins and ends in a logical way, and brings worth summaries. Even though
stuff is rephrased several times in the same chapter, it’s not boring at
all, and helps with the recall. If you listen to this book as an audiobook
just like I did, you’ll find that helpful.
