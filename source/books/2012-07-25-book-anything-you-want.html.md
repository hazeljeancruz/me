abstract: >
  Derek Sivers is a pretty influential entrepreneur and a coder.
  I enjoyed reading his words as much as his code, yet this book is a great
  read, on par with "Lean Startup" and "Rework". Go and read. You won't
  regret. If I ever make a software startup bootstrapping bible, this book
  will be somewhere there.

About Derek I learnt by accident.

Sort of.

After reading Spolsky's blog and his recommendation of doing some writing on
the side as a next step in boosting your communication skills, I came up
with an idea for making my own page, where I could write this and that.

I knew little about blogs, so I Googled this and that, and found "Technical
Blogging":

While reading reviews, I've found Derek's name, and after reading about him
for 5 minutes, I decided I must start following what this guy has to say.

My friend Alan asked me once whether we'll have to work our assess off in
order to get into the league of people who claim to know what business is all
about, or whether it'd be possible after reading 5 books.

Well, I didn't know the answer back then, but now I feel like you can gain
+5 years of experience by reading..

The book is among "Lean Startup" and "E-myth revisited" probably the most
influential book I've ever read.

Derek started something we could call a hot-dog stand. Just like Howard
Jonas, he started from whatever seemed to make sense to him, maybe with one
exception: looks like Derek didn't know he'll end up with $22M for his
company.

What is being described is a true lean approach to business: don't take
money from anybody, start small, work your way up, charge from the day #1.
Listen to customers and offer high-end treatment for them and their orders.
If I were to state several rules, these would be the ones to follow.

There's also amazingly unique thing about Derek -- he answers to e-mails
from us, poor ants straight from the Internet cloud.

I highly suggest this book to anybody, even those not interested in having a
business. We could say that Derek's book is one of these American stories
that happen to be true. You can find proofs by just clicking!

Simply: MUST HAVE.
