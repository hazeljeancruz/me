This book is similar in nature to other guides, but it's fairly packed.
It's a very useful little title that I picked up, since as a non-native
speaker, you naturally "miss" things other people may find obvious.

This is one of the top bestsellers on books about writing.

Zinsser went though the written English language in points and he explained
how to remove clutter, simplify your English and bump up your writing. It's
the first book where I understood that the passive voice weakens your
expression.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around how to apply it, since there are so
many suggestions and rules. What I believe I'd need during my second reading
is a checklist of some sort.

The book is easier to digest than [The Elements of
Style](http://amzn.to/2lmcnbq), but not as popular, judging by the Amazon
ratings. Up to you then which one you pick.
