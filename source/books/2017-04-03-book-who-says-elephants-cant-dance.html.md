IBM was not on the top of my list for doing my entrepreneurial studies, and
somehow I learned about this book by accident.

Not only was this book great, but it's also written by  Louis V. Gerstner,
who's an ex CEO of IBM.

You should take a look at it, if you ever want to do something
entrepreneurial, and especially if you're in business.
