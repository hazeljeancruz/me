title:  "Procrastination: Why You Do It, What to Do About It Now"
author: "Wojciech Adam Koszek"
abstract: >
  If you're bothered by the endless projects, or many unfinished tasks on
  your to-do list, this book is great. It addresses very many types of
  syndromes our busy minds are dealing with. It's a mediacally-backed book
  and it gives some good hints on how to deal with procrastination. This
  booked helped me understand some procrastination elements I noticed in myself.
