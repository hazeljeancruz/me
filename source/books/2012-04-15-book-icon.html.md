  I've found this book to be an enjoyable take on leadership within
  Apple. It gave me background into what Apple products and Steve Jobs was
  all about back then, when I didn't even use Apple products at all. Maybe
  you shouldn't read it if you want to start using their products one day?

**NOTE** This review reads quite funny now, 4 years after I originally wrote
it. Since then I've moved to Apple ecosystem and I'm quite happy because of
it.

Not being Apple practitioner didn't stop me from reading about Apple and
Steve Jobs:

**Some conclusions.**
Consistent project vision and design. Have you ever read
*Mythical man-month*?
I see an reverse analogy between S/360 and Apple -- having a leader with a
vision of a product line is important. It's sometimes interesting how really
big products can succeed when being designed by one person. The most I
impressed was by
*Inside AS/400*
which apparently was designed by a single person.

**Book.**
The book outlines lives of Apple and Steve Jobs. In some moments it's too
much of preaching of Jobs being #2 right after God, but in general it was
pleasant to read (factor price/content is very good for this book)

Summary of the book:

+ Start small
+ User experience 1st; then technology
+ Loosing is always good. I see an analogy between what Jobs had done and
