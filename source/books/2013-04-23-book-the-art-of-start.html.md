  Not sure about this one. Didn't remember much from it. It's short, so
  maybe you can read it through your public library first?

Kawasaki's book I read long time ago, It's a nice little booklet, relatively
short, relatively packed with content.

So hey -- I did what I did with other recommendations of books.

I made up a date in which I want other people think I read it, and after a
short break I'm trying to tune jazzy swingy samba sound in the background
and recall what did I got from the book.

Honestly -- I don't really remember. It was some standard stuff on starting
now, figuring things our quickly, making sure they work, adjusting if they
don't and if they fail, starting over.

Anyway, I just want to tell you: nice, sunny Saturday. Errands done. Air
with a really nice flower smell, right after shower, early morning,
walking slowly to the Caltrain station I decided to visit Arrillaga's center
Menlo Park library for their amazing bargains on used book and..

My day was destroyed.

There isn't anything worse than go to a library and by looking at a poster
understanding that you're 30 minutes late for the Guy Kawasaki's talk about
entrepreneurship. Nothing worse.

Ok, almost nothing.

Reading stupid poster, looking at your watch and seeing this Asian guy
leaving the library and understanding he's really similar to the guy
preaching about free worldwide flights with a blessing straight from Steve
Jobs..

Yes. Exactly.

Or understanding your favorite drummer just gave a clinic for $10 in the
city 10 minutes away from you.

Yes. Pretty bad Saturday.

Next point which is very wrong: not a single thing teaches you quick
enough thinking. What I should have done was to catch the guy and offer him
lunch at Stacks.

Oh well. I'm pretty sure he'll read it and offer me a lunch at Stacks.

Anyway: worth reading. However it's like a class on multiple programming
languages on your university -- it points our things exists, but don't
explain them well. You'll have to read other books from my list to get a
feel on things like "bootstrapping", branding and positioning.

And do not look at posters in the library if you see the date is past due.
