The thing is that IMVU's idea was one of the most ridiculous thing I've ever
heard. But it's only because I don't buy ideas with virtual reality. I'm a
retarded alien who just enjoys fresh air and nature. So ... I expected this
book will be about absolute failure.

And to some sense, it was. But not entirely.

After this lecture, I think I understand the lean business process more..

I hope you'll skip this book, so that I can be ahead.

DON'T READ THIS BOOK.
