This book would be fine if you aren't impatient.

Contrary to what one could think, seeing the title, it's less targeted
towards hackers.

I'd expect that it's directed towards technical people, who may not be
interested in the whole story and knowledge of the art history.

So I was disappointed. So will you.

Much better is the "Non-designers design book". Why? It's shorter and
more to the point, if you want to build products, and you want to get
fast 101 on design.
