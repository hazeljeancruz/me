This is the best book so far from all books I've seen about Verilog.

Don't get me wrong: it's "just OK" compare to some computer programming
books out there, but in terms of digital design, I can recommend it.

This book showed me direct relationship between the Verilog syntax and
actual resulting circuit in the device.

If you have a problem mapping ``if`` and ``else`` and ternary operators to
the hardware, I recommend this book to you.

Covering two HDLs hurt this book a lot--I found skipping VHDL chapters
painful, especially that some of the topics explained in one language aren't
explained in another one. Yes, it's due to syntax, yet I'd like author to
show, even by hacking, that basically you can achieve the very same circuits
with both languages with a bit of a pain.

Pricey!

If I hadn't gotten this book, I wouldn't have written this review. Thank you
John!
