This books is meant to be a collection of letters from Hedrian to Marcus
Aurelius. Great content and excellent research has been done to actually
provide enough details about the insights about Hadrian.

The structure was so-so, since "letters" are way too long, and in general
I'd had a feeling that the story isn't really going anywhere.

The fact that it's all has been written by someone who actually didn't live
in the same times as Harian is pretty remarkable.
