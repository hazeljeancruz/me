title:	"Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie"
author: "Wojciech Adam Koszek"
description: >
  Really long book. Got lost many times during listening of an audiobook.
  Similar format to "The first tycoon" on Vanderbilt. These books are too
  long and cover too many things. I feel like it's only interesting if
  you're a history junkie.

I don't know how many times I've been starting this audiobook and giving up,
since the beginning of this book is pretty stiff. Some days I preferred to
just drive without anything in my ears, than just starting this book. Be
armored with patience! But having gotten used to the author's tone and pace
and tempo, I proceed with it.

Something is sure about this book -- the story of Carnegie's life is very
different to what we see in nowadays in Silicon Valley. It was neither fast
nor innovative, and book explains slow and gradual process of him becoming a
steel magnate.

The century difference also makes it pretty fascinating, as it touches
topics like iron to steel transition and bridge building. Partially
different, the majority of entrepreneurial stuff still holds true.

In other words: unless like modern stories of technology-related success,
where things happen in short time, which people spoiled by modern times
expect, Carnegie's story was slightly less interesting, since it actually
took him years before being able to claim he succeeded in something.

Listen only when interested in the history of the US.
