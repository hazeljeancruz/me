Short, little, geeky story about Linus and Linux, copyrights and ownership,
coding, software culture and others like that.

This book met my expectations and delivered good outline on the history of
Linux development.

The thing which I didn't know before was that Linus stole MINIX mailing
lists and that he was doing release announcements there.
