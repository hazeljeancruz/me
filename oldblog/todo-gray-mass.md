Instead of studying the theory and practice of flip-flops and how inferring
latches is Evil in the modern Hardware Description Languages, I decided to
describe something that is relevant to my current and future job.

##### Sad introduction #####

Having experience with big companies, I must say I'm pretty depressed while
reading about old-school, Silicon Valley, creative, lean, startup-alike
companies full of smart people, who gathered together every single day for 8
days in a week and worked 25 hours per day, listened to extremely loud,
hard-code Beatles music, didn't listen to parents and used to build, along
with eating pizza and drinking Coke, complex products solving real-world
problems and actually helping people.  Of course everybody was socially
awkward, since being socially awkward defines you can build great things.
Quickly. No questions asked. Everything worked for the 1st time. No testing.
We all know that.

[up to you to figure out the parts which I'd like to bring back to the
modern workplaces]

And by products which help people I don't mean building Yet Another iPhone
App which will make your cat's pictures be sent to your Facebook account in
greyscale, or even in sepia. I mean real products, real meat, which is easy
to spot from 1 mile distance.

Don't get me wrong if you write an app for making your cat's photos be sent
to Facebook in grayscale in sepia. That's very cool, I bet, but I mean
something more ambitious.

You might actually sell this product for $10^9 dollars and laugh loud from
us, stupid people, while sitting on your private island somewhere in
Caribbean part of the world.

If you feel horribly offended right now, let me tell you - stop reading now
and get back to your mobile network for sharing XYZ, where XYZ is, I don't
know. Something. I don't care.

#### Data General ####

Guys from Data General had build a computer, for example. Flagship product of
the company at that time. But it was long time ago, I know, I know.

And oh boy, oh boy. I've heard an opinion of the person that "they've been
working these people to death; that's crazy; that's stupid". Or that Marvell
is "such a hard place to work for". Maybe it is, maybe it's not. I don't
know. Working hard lets you learn new stuff, at least, and from what I see,
unless you have lots of time (no full-time job, free weekends), there's no
other way than just "find yourself fortunate enough to be able to have
pressure to gather new knowledge".

Every smart person from CS/EE industry is fine working more than expected,
as long as the job is interesting.  Internships are like that (highly
recommended) This isn't just a random crap that a newbie is writing. Some
other smarter guys write about that too:

#### Working your ass off ####

Working harder has some benefits. Typically doing it for some time means you'll have to
do it for a shorter period of time--you'll either die quicker or take
advantage of your knowledge/experience and grow.

Lots of young people who I meet think about finding a job.
These aren't immigrants trapped on the American land without a visa.
We're talking about predecessors of generation who came here to create their
own workplace,  yet their attitude shifted to "work for somebody"
direction.
We're talking my age range [33.33% of the age of randomly
chosen Polish grandmother]
Stanford/Palo Alto/Menlo Park is different though, thus living here is
interesting.
So lets be honest -- you're an interesting person if
you think working 8hr/day for next 42 years is easy.
It's pretty hard for me to even think about it.
Unless you do something VERY interesting.
If you write real-time, mission critical software for nuclear power plant I
understand you're just fine working full-time.

#### Would you rather ####

There's this game - "Would you rather...".

If you're from The
Old Lands, I know you qualify to compete in "Would you rather..." with me,
since the sense of humor of guys from "The Old Lands" is the same and you
won't claim I'm just yet another primitive rude asshole.  (No definition for
Old Lands here, until you start to know me in person.  They you can think of
asking, and I'll think on replying).

Anyway -- lots of the people can't play in "Would you rather ...":

	"Would you rather  work on something interesting and learn, or earn a lot" pick "Earn a lot".

	"Would you rather do X or Y" pick whichever is safer.

etc.

End these aren't bad answers. The problem is that most of answers I get are
"I don't know".  I see older people knowing what they want and actually
knowing what they wanted where they started to do engineering. It's pretty
depressing that these are the only people in big companies, who know what
they want.

Anyway, I'll make a long story short to not bore you to death: I don't
remember when I achieved anything or learned valuable stuff
was in times when Internet in Europe was really expensive.  Sitting on
websites or IRCs was just freaking expensive, so books were the rescue. The
conclusion is that my current knowledge didn't come from ready-to-use,
high-quality classes on the university and it wasn't easy. It was pretty
hard, and there was lots of pain related with it.
Books ain't cheap, y'all know that, and this is where I got most of the
knowledge from.

I don't know why should I stop now. Over the university, when it was clear
there won't be too much benefit for me from all these Java Hibernate and SQL
frameworks, I started doing some hardware bits and soon realized doing
software won't be enough for me, since still under this bare-metal surface
sits something that can actually be described in the Vim's window and
simulated, and synthesized.

So this is how I started thinking about hardware companies as my potential
employers, since you didn't have to be too smart to understand that hardware
company is this kind of business that requires lots of low-level software
and assembly language c0ders.

Oh boy. This will be something that might be problem no. 1 in my life.
Hardware companies aren't too fun to work for. At least nowadays. At least
big ones.

Really.

Where the hell do you find places like The Old Corps in the Valley nowadays?
Where new college graduates are exposed to this tactic of letting them do
something important and having them build something useful?

Right now I think it's mostly about grunge work. When a PhD on my university
told me his company is making LOTS of money by buying ready to use
components from the Delphi-module journal, putting them all together with a
glue, and selling, I really couldn't believe. I understood selling products
as building new stuff, from the ground. I considered ready-to-use API
interfaces fine, since it's impossible to write JPEG compressor from scratch
each time your write an image manipulation program, but buying whole
modules, with forms, and basing your products on it?

Not always your project can encompass building LibSSL for your
secure communication. Or even RSA-based security.

Even building stupid FLViz - the visual simulator of finite-state machines
made me realize that building good software nowadays is all about APIs and
ready-to-use modules, since in order to get your FSM represented nicely,
with round circles and lines between them not crossing in an odd ways, you
have to have a ready-to-use library.

(Algorithms used in Graphviz are something people have been writing PhD
thesis on, so when my Professor said he would have written similar program in
Turbo Pascal, without any library, over duration of 2 days, I knew it's not
Turbo Pascal but FORTRAN he last must have touched)

I somehow didn't see this problem with hardware. Hennessy&Patterson books,
the two most influential books I've read which made me run into serious
trouble, somehow didn't explain how building CPUs looks like nowadays.

But it's all about ready-to-use boxes, which people just glue together and
keep testing.

To DEATH.

Partly, I believe, problem comes from size of nowadays products. I don't
know exact numbers for judging small, medium or big companies. Lockheed
Martin I've read the other day has 100,000 people. That's freaking big
number, and more than their technology I'm pretty impressed with the
management style in these corporations.

(Don't cross your elbows on your stomach and don't laugh yet if you're from
Lockheed Martin. I mean every company from BigEvil5)

Chips company's from what I see are anything from 100 to ... =pick a BIG
number here= people.

True, true. These old days were when CPU's ALU unit consisted several PCB
boards, wired together with some form of rope and a duct tape and God Lord
knows what else. Nowhere near 3.5nm technology costing trillions. I know
that. That's not important here.

But it looks to me industry is all about integration of elements other
people do, while these 'other people' remain undefined, since this group is
so small that it's hard to spot.

I could include some more examples from all the piles of used, historical
books ordered from Amazon for $0.01 each, but let me save you some time.
They might be as valuable as $0.01 nowadays.

Looks like there are three groups of people. And by the way -- honestly -- I
don't think about anybody in particular while writing this, so if you eat a
lunch with me, don't ask me which group are you in. This is my general
general understanding of big companies, correlated with numerous other
people [from these companies] and friends and collegues etc.

0. *Nice human being* -- due to the nature of life of character, you just
   work for a company. Good employee. Happy family member, maybe even
   father. Haven't fallen into trap of being interested in what you do, so
   after working hours you might even have a hobby not related with what you
   do at work.  True value of the company, that's to the steady factor of
   work done. My dear team, if you read this, I know you all are here!
   ...while I'm not.

1. *young fawn* -- big company is cool, since you can work more in the
   night, wheeee! You can break things for free and people don't blame you
   since you're young and stupid Whee!  Put interns in this box.
   Internships worked excellently for me, since this kind of feeling gives
   you lots of freedom. New College Grads, fresh out of college, without
   internships.  Interns and NCGs are good, since these guys generate
   revenue, since this is the group which does real work, which does actual
   stuff that nobody else is willing to do.

2. *Bearded guys* -- if Captain Nemo were to step out of the Nautilus, this
   is how he'd like. They can do whatever they want, how they want for
   anybody, for how much they want. No veto. Hawaiian shirt is a must. Pen
   in the chest-pocket isn't uncommon. As are leftovers of your yesterdays
   lunch, about which nobody cares, since they know you're responsible for
   X, where X is something your company doesn't exist without. OK, maybe
   that's a bit too much, but generally I see people doing technically
   interesting stuff only if they have 20 years of experience.

3. *gray mass* -- not sure why and not sure what. Goes to job and prunes
   list of tasks lined up in queue. No questions asked. PERFECT employee for
   a big corporation (longer queue is better). Think of EA in 2005. If
   you've reached so far I doubt you're in this category, unless my writing
   style with all these cute mistakes and lack of articles is appealing to
   you. Otherwise, you haven't reached that far if you're within gray mass
   since its members just don't read un-selectively; anything above
   expectation isn't read at all Let me me tell you why.

If you enter already as a member of Nice Human Being group, you're just
fine. You don't need to do anything and you're pretty damn lucky.

Group number 3 doesn't have to do anything either. That's all!

*Faws* and *Bearded guys* are the most problematic, since from what I see
there's 20 years of difference in terms of experience and simply there are
very little structures built in big corporations to have this age and
knowledge gap closed.

Building teams across experience levels seems uncommon. It doesn't surprise
me, since I'd have a hard time working with people who have never programmed
computer before I guess, and this is how I believe *Bearded guys* can view
me, young Fawn.

These stories from the old time, about young people doing something
valuable, I believe, are there just so that senior
guys who entered 21st century on their own legs can make laugh at us, silly
people, who started their computer career from Turbo Pascal on the PC
computer, with 8MB of RAM, while they, old gurus, Greek godheads, with
lightnings in their hands, were punching their algorithms with a screwdriver
on a paper towels and "Gosh, it worked SOOO well".

Or maybe places like that still exist? Where products are built with blood
and pain, and fists flying around, where the leader is one, everything is
decided based on technical merits, and finally, where little Fawns can
actually learn something from *Bearded man*. I find 15-minute chats with
advanced people mean more than any other communication with people who just
aren't yet there, or never will, because they have different targets. It's
like the productivity rule of 90% of work being delivered by 10% of people,
and one top-1% of people being 10x better than people following.

The only way to get to this 1% without 30 years of work is to get to the
environment where you're forced to work with senior members. But I haven't
figured out how to do that. And whether it's still possible in the age,
where CPU is modeled in millions lines of code, and not a single human being
understands what's really going on underneath all these abstraction layers.
