Immigrant Entrepreneur's guide to inexpensive education
-------------------------------------------------------

Amazing park about being in the US is ... books.

Books are in my ecosystem since the very early on. No, I won't start the
typical story on how I learnt to read at the age of 9 months, and ended up
fininshed Greek literature classics by the age of 4. No.

Books were just present in my life-style, as most of my family comes from
the community of teachers (I'm the only one not doing teaching).

Books are expensive? Well, sort of, yes. When you try to enroll to the
university, all sorts of tables from universities websites will list
prices and what out-of-pocket cost you can expect. Let me tell ya'll--it's a

But books aren't expensive. Imagine for a example that you're an investor in
a high-tech startup with talented developers and you are expected to .. do
what investors do, which is to use blogs and brag about their employees.

So you go outside, lie on grass and ponder how to make sure whatever you
write is going to be correct, pure, clean, simple and easy to understand.

And you think: Chicago Manual of Style is the answer.


No, they're not.
