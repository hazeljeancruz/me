<h3>NOTES</h3>

<p>Think about me whatever you want, I don't care -- I like Larry.</p>

<p>Lets say this: from all the books I've read the common thing between all
leaders is that they happen (accidently?) business oriented.</p>

<p>Some people say: Microsoft is sh@t, they never figured out anything by
themselves, they stole DOS from a company that code fraction of what they
could really earn. They delivered stuff that wasn't stable, nearly never
work and of course -- software design is wrong. APIs suck as hell.</p>

<p>Well: if you have enough guts, try to follow this "easy" path and achieve
10% of the success. Really: why to steal. There's tons of tons of Open
Source software. BSD licensed. Ready to be stolen, packaged. You gran BSD
license, put it under "License" button nobody ever clicks and you can claim
to have your own private 1980's and become this bad Microsoft.</p>

<p>So the exactly same thing I hear with Larry.</p>

<p>He just stole IBM's idea that of course didn't come from him. And just took
this existing idea that nobody felt is possible to implement it and he
implemented it. And this is bad, since of course only your ideas implemented
count and it's the only way to get praised for your work. So they he just
found customers and he just risked whatever he had to deliver database to
customers.</p>

<p>Geeky argument is that of course it didn't work, and well, it might be true.
But being first is better than being ... better, so here we are, in 2013
with cloud computing, small supercomputers with 3GHz multi-chip many-cores
running slow Oracle, since well.... Larry decided to ship his semi-working
database 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Once again: take a publication that you think is really hot, make a code
around it, market it, find customers, sell it and here you are -- begging
for forgiveness because I bet you'll realize it's pretty damn hard.</p>

<p>Why don't I do it?</p>

<p>Well, as you see I don't criticize.</p>

<p>Think whatever you want. Larry is cool. Building a company for $B lets you
do lots of cool stuff, like help children in Africa. Looks like he's really
involved, since he understand that teaching poor and hungry children is
pretty damn hard (I know -- one of my high-school was to donate stuff to
orphanage and visit these kids later). So here you go -- Oracle spending
tons of $$$ by selling their crappy database on shipping food to Africa.</p>

<p>Larry maybe isn't the best charitable institution - building $100M Japanese
garden just because you can isn't maybe what we expect from the entrepreneur
of his caliber, but on the other hand -- he also wanted to have some fun out
of this hell.</p>

<p>Book worth reading: shows Amazon-alike model of growth, where you do
whatever is necessary to ship your unique and innovative project regardless
of the stage it is in.</p>

<p>If you want to have reacher perspective on the history of the world most
famous software companies, I can highly recommend this reading.</p>
