<h3>NOTES</h3>

<p><em>Full title: How to Delegate Work and Ensure It's Done Right.</em></p>

<p>I picked one of my weak points and decided to see what other people can tell
me about it.</p>

<p>Lohr's audio program was pretty good. He mentions one of the key points of
delegation, which includes: delegation as a key of making really big
projects possible. The thing I typically have a problem is is delegation of
stuff which I know I can do well by myself.</p>

<p>The bad thing is that once I'm set on the model of how given activity must
be performed or I know how the method of achieving the goal should look
like, it's quite hard to convince me otherwise.</p>

<p>I think there's the biggest conflict in delegation, where there's little
pressure on a method, and where the push is toward expected result.</p>

<p>Seeing people achieving the goal with incorrect method is kind of painful
for me, so ... oh well. I think I'll just keep trying to apply "7 habits..."
and "How to win friends.." approaches and trying hard to adjust other people
methods to mine. But, of course, only when I know my method is better.</p>

<p>Paying attention on a method makes sense to me, since I think some results
can not be achieved when doing thing wrong, just like it's hard to get
perfect double stroke roll without holding drum sticks correctly.</p>

<p>Interesting concept in delegation is holding people accountable, which in
turn includes making sure the goal is properly understood. By properly I
mean: both sides see the problem and goal in the same way.</p>

<p>After delegation of the task, the concept of rephrasing it once again for
clarify was being touched. This is something I already apply on a daily
basis and which I see multiple advanced engineers use.</p>

<p>The idea of asking people to do it is new to me. Honestly what the program
mentions is very hard to achieve. I spotted people get very sensitive when
there's the smallest doubt about their understanding of what you told them.
In other words: like a dog people smell the doubt in them and start to apply
defensive mechanisms.</p>

<p>If you're a Polish immigrant abroad, you have a strong competitive
advantage--after phrasing the goal, you can easily blame eventual lack of
the clarity in your crappy English, so basically get the goal rephrased for
free. Whooo!!</p>

<p>Anyway--I'd qualify this audio program as a positive addition in case you
happen to work on bigger projects in your career.</p>
