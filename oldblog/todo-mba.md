Secret

I decided to get familiar with books which I could call "American Classics".
We could say I became a real fan of those.
Several last books which I've finished include:

## How to stop worrying and start living ##
**by Dale Carnegie**

Highly recommended to people dealing with lots of stuff in their life.
If you're forced to do multitasking in your life, this book will likely
help you.
Main message is to not worry unless problems happen.
Be prepared, but not worried.
The difference between "concern" and "worry" is explained.
Just like most motivational books, unless based on facts, this book has
lots of sample stories.
I believe most of them are myths.
However they make book more "understandable", since otherwise I bet this would be
one of these dry, boring read-while-waiting-for-your-dentist lectures.
Very good summary on the law of averages, where you judge the problems by
probability of their appearing.
It's also about self-mastery, and keeping up with your own emotions.
Largely about personal control.
"What worry can do to you" actually applies fully to lots of situations from
everybody's life.
Chapter __How I conquered worry__ was the most interesting, even though not
being the author's work.
Very good concept from the book is to always try to collect facts on the
problem, before making judgement.
Maps well to
[X11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System)
principle *"If a problem is not completely understood, it is probably best to
provide no solution at all"*.
**Mandatory reading for big corporations**

## Things from The Dean of Personal Development ##
**by.... read on..**

About this gentleman I've learned by absolute accident, when my mother gave
my Rhonda Byrne's book __The Secret__.
If I remember correctly, the back cover claims it's a logical continuation
of classics like __"The Strangest Secret"__.
And this is how I started to know who Earl Nightingale is.
I went through all of his work in, audio form.
__Strangest Secret__ is very significant part of this motivational content.
There was too much excellent new things in these lectures, to be able to
mention them all.
I'd say it's a 1:1 correspondence with Napoleon Hill "Think and Grow rich"
rules, covering much wider (broader) range of things.
I really like the idea of:

>	"You become what you think about"

which is often paraphrased to all sort of different forms.
It's very interesting to read author's biography on Wikipedia:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Nightingale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Nightingale)

Before I started studying his work, I believed it was just yet another
"resource".
I wasn't aware this lectures were broadcast in the American radio.
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have worked in Europe, since people are less
willing to hear "preachings".

## How to win friends and influence people ##
**by Dale Carnegie**

This is very good interpersonal communication guide for everybody who's
stuck with working with people.
For the American corporate culture, this is one of "must read" books.
This is what I recommend as an introduction to leadership.
Book is perfect for hi-tech employees, who work with intellectual work on a
daily basis, and who are expected to review and correct other people's work.
Chapter on criticizing and collaboration was truly remarkable, so instead
of:

>	"I want you to ..."

I'm trying:

>	"I'd suggest..."

Or

>	"If I were you..."

I do notice "soft" aspects of this book not always work "at work",
but dealing with events like Google Code-In:
[http://www.google-melange.com/](http://www.google-melange.com/)
makes time spend on this book justifiable.
At work I see lots of senior people using:

> Based on my 12-year experience with ...., I think you're wrong.

So for next couple of years I'll have to stick to "How to win.." rules.
**Mandatory book for people who have problems with social skills**

## On getting rich ##
**recordings by Napoleon Hill**

Quality of the audio recordings from
[http://www.youtube.com](YouTube)
is impressive:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Aw8xfT541eQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I finished all of these lectures.
He's an excellent speaker -- perfect rhetoric.
Very hard to get your attention directed towards anything but the audio
track.
Definiteness of purpose and burning desire is something that I see works for
a lot of people.
I'm trying to apply these rules to my life too.

## Effective people ##

The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey

## Winning ##
**by Jack Welch, Suzy Welch**

Classic written by an industry giant, CEO of General Electric for 20 years.
20 years... Nearly as long as I'm on the world -- that's pretty long in general, I'd say.
He started working at GE 1960, and quit 2001.
That's 41 years!
It was funny to hear a person who rose GE value 4000% wanted to quit his job, at some stage.
It is very interesting book, which made me realize $1 billion dollar
investments (jet engine example) are sometimes signed by 1 person.
Not individually of course, but the responsibility is still there.
And it's interesting to understand how HUGE company like GE differs from the
mobility and agility described in all sorts of startup books.
Good advices about long-term thinking.
Techniques of hiring and firing people are scattered all over the book.
Old American culture is also shown here -- I remember especially the chapter
about work/life balance, where he mentions in the old times there was no balance
at all and how it was all about working your ass off for the company.
The whole golf story was cool too.

## Microserfs ##
**by Douglas Coupland**

I had a mixed feelings about this one.
It described strange culture of Microsoft and their corporate environment.
I can assume some stuff changed till now (2012), but I wonder how much is
preserved.
When I've heard all theses descriptions of people living on Coke, my feelings
was to drop computers whatsoever.
My personal experiences shows that the most technically skilled people are
just normal, not "freaky".
Descriptions made me think about "The Soul of a New Machine", which was
similar, and Apple environment described in "iCON" and several others, so it
looks like very geeky behavior 

## Getting to Yes ##
**Roger Fisher, William L. Ury and Bruce Patton**

I watched Nigerian movie "Freedom" (1957), and was thinking about this book.
In the movie one of African tribe leaders tries to find a common interest
between other tribe leaders, and tries to have them agree on goals.
This all mapped well to the content of the section 2 of the book "The
method", and especially to "Separate the people from the problem" approach.
In the big company this book should be a mandatory reading.

## Little Red Book Of Selling ##
**by Jeffrey Gitomer**

Looks like

**by Eric Ries**

excellent book

No plan survives the contact with the customer.
if you have nothing, you have nothing to loose.

## REWORK ##
**by Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson**

dynamism
completely new approach to work
different idea of starting the business

## Anything you want ##
**by Derek Sivers**

Derek's book has lots of wise words about business in general.
Story of CDBaby is pretty interesting, especially that lots of the ideas can
be applied to pretty much any kind of a business.
High quality service and unique (Squid) treatment of customers are the parts
which all small business owners have to follow.

**by Thomas Stanley, William Danko**

Very good outline of wealth in the US.
This book is an excellent source of statistical data on how money gets
produced.
