The thing which makes new college graduates not want to talk to me is that I
typically try to ask basic questions about certain concepts which nowadays
are claimed to be an 'obvious knowledge'.

Like object oriented programming, so called OOP if you have to have an
acronym.

The thing with OOP is that instead of seeing program as a flow of
instructions accessing various data items sitting on lists, queues and
trees and basically executing sequential algorhitms for accessing memory, you
view your program as Mother Earth, but miniaturized.

So no longer you have a function:

	complex_add(complex_t *v1, complex_t *v2)

You may have:

	v1 += v2;

instead, and given that v1 and v2 stand for something more complex that a
typical, built-in type, you have += overloaded, so that even though v1 and
v2 are of non-standard types (like classes) you can still do += and have
compiler understand what you mean.

This is

Basically no longer there are datastructures and

I overemphesize of course. OOP isn't that bad. But I draw a line here to
show, that lots of people somehow can't think of programs as something that
doesn't have methods and classes.

Obiect Oriented programming

OOP isn't that bad.
