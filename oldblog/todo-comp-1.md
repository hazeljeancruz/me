When you're young, let say 15-19 young things are pretty straightforward. Of
course when you have 1st person perspective, it never is easy. However as
you get older you want to get back to good old times.

Lots of times has been spent in my teen years on making cool techy stuff. I
worked on FreeBSD, system administration and programming, with special
interests of electronics and device drivers.

Basically when I finished 16 I knew I'll be doing UNIX device drivers sooner
or later. Then I moved to: why do I need UNIX. Maybe I can write code for
bare metal. And the next evolution was Verilog, where I learnt that I can
literally write code for the whole hardware/software stack.

And literally.... the very last thing I could imagine myself doing was
writing WWW or Windows applications. Last. Really.

However as the time past by and I understood and defined what is really
important in my life, I soon understood that doing niche techy stuff isn't
the way to go. I believe my main hobbies aren't techy at all, and now when I
think about it, I've never been a geek.

Starting your company by all means isn't easy. The most frustrating thing
about starting company in the US.
