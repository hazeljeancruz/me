<h3>NOTES</h3>

<p>Didn't really know what to think about this book. Started just fine--nice
story about New York City and having fun. Author described his niche habit
of drawing things on the back of business cards, and how people felt it's
ridiculous. </p>

<p>His faith in doing something he liked and believed in was one of the
advices. This is a point of view not matching the interative, incremental
model of improvement and trying to walk over and adjust. He matched whatever
he wanted.</p>

<p>Funny thing is that I saw so many contradictions to young entrepreneur
bibles like "REWORK" and "Lean Startup", that it gave me a broader
perspective. Looks like just like within 2 engineers you get 3 proposed
solutions, with people writing about business you get only theirs
perspective. Here comes the strength of reading many books on the same
topic -- you get confidence factor.</p>

<p>Like making sure idea is yours. Personally I like: "it's not the idea, it's
execution" model. Similarly, throwing ideas to other people and observing
their reaction. Is you get 10/10 fail rate in terms of sharing and querying
people about your idea, in my opinion this might turn out to be a valid
customer interest representation. Yet I see the point. Being Opera browser
users I look at w3schools.com statistics and I see ONLY 1.8%. So I look at
the Wikipedia page of usage share among browsers and I see some random
160,000,000 number of hits per month. Now applying 1.8% to this gives you
2,880,000 hits done with Opera. How would you feel knowing 2,8M people have
your program installed and actually do something with it?</p>

<p>How I ask?</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Exactly. Anyway:</p>

<p>He touched an important point why was such a thing possible--model of
starting a business as a side project. This gives you (1) inability of
performing this 24/7 and (2) giving you freedom to innovate, since with
another bill paying job you're not limited to whatever customers request.
Good luck dear H1B visa holders!</p>

<p>However the thing about not depending that after quiting your daily job
things suddenly will become a road straight to Eden is true. I think
starting small and doing market probing of some sort and figuring out
whether people are interested is a better approach. Any good books on market
probing? Huh? Anybody?</p>

<p>The thing I feel was purposefully placed in a book are sexually-intensive
bridges between chapters, which act as a random thoughts brought and thrown
on the reader without a major sense and connection to the context of the
chapter. Personally I don't like it. However bring pretty sure MacLeod did
it to get more advertising and become more memorable--we can forgive that.</p>
