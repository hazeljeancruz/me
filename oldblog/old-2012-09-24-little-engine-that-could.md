Instead of studying the theory and practice of flip-flops and how inferring
latches is Evil in the modern Hardware Description Languages, I decided to
describe something that is relevant to my current and future job. Or rather:
I decided to collect some random conclusions, in random order and deliver
the answer to the question which was never asked. Moral is up to you.
Conclusion is to make this disorganized mess be more structured.

##### Sad introduction #####

![crying baby](/img/0060-0807-3002-2211_Baby_Crying_clipart_image.jpg)

Having experience with big companies, I must say I'm pretty depressed while
reading about old-school, Silicon Valley, creative, lean, startup-alike
companies full of smart people, who gathered together every single day for 8
days in a week and worked 25 hours per day, listened to extremely loud,
hard-code Beatles music, didn't listen to parents and used to build, along
with eating pizza and drinking Coke, complex products solving real-world
problems and actually helping people.  Of course everybody was socially
awkward, since being socially awkward defines you can build great things.
Quickly. No questions asked. Everything worked for the 1st time. No testing.
We all know that.

**..up to you to figure out the parts which I'd like to bring back to the
modern workplaces**

And by products which help people I don't mean building Yet Another iPhone
App which will make your cat's pictures be sent to your Facebook account in
greyscale, or even in sepia. I mean real products, real meat, which is easy
to spot from 1 mile distance.

Don't get me wrong if you write an app for making your cat's photos be sent
to Facebook in grayscale in sepia. That's very cool, I bet, but I mean
something more ambitious.

You might actually sell this product for $10^9 dollars and laugh loud from
us, stupid coding people, while sitting on your private island somewhere in
Caribbean part of the world.

If you feel horribly offended right now, let me tell you - stop reading now
and get back to your mobile network for sharing XYZ, where XYZ is, I don't
know. Something. I don't care.

#### Data General ####

![Nova](/img/Data-General.nova.decastro.c1968.102635442.lg.jpg)

Guys from Data General had build a computer, for example. Flagship product of
the company at that time. But it was long time ago, I know, I know.

And oh boy, oh boy. I've heard an opinion of the person that "they've been
working these people to death; that's crazy; that's stupid". Or that Marvell
is "such a hard place to work for". Maybe it is, maybe it's not. I don't
know. Working hard lets you learn new stuff, at least, and from what I see,
unless you have lots of time (no full-time job, free weekends), there's no
other way than just "find yourself fortunate enough to be able to have
pressure to gather new knowledge".

Every smart person from CS/EE industry is fine working more than expected,
as long as the job is interesting.  Internships are like that (highly
recommended) This isn't just a random crap that a newbie is writing. Some
other smarter guys write about that too:

#### Working your ass off? ####

![hard work](/img/hard_work.png)

Working harder has some benefits. Typically doing it for some time means you'll have to
do it for a shorter period of time--you'll either die quicker or take
advantage of your knowledge/experience and grow.

Lots of young people who I meet think about finding a job.
These aren't immigrants trapped on the American land without a visa.
We're talking about predecessors of generation who came here to create their
own workplace,  yet their attitude shifted to "work for somebody"
direction.
We're talking my age range [33.33% of the age of randomly
chosen Polish grandmother]
Stanford/Palo Alto/Menlo Park is different though, thus living here is
interesting.
So lets be honest -- you're an interesting person if
you think working 8hr/day for next 42 years is easy.
It's pretty hard for me to even think about it.
Unless you do something VERY interesting.
If you write real-time, mission critical software for nuclear power plant I
understand you're just fine working full-time.

#### Would you rather... ####

![Would you rather](/img/littledogfatwoman.jpg)

There's this game - "Would you rather...". 

If you're from The
Old Lands, I know you qualify to compete in "Would you rather..." with me,
since the sense of humor of guys from "The Old Lands" is the same and you
won't claim I'm just yet another primitive rude asshole (No definition for
Old Lands here, until you start to know me in person. They you can think of
asking, and I'll think on replying).

Anyway -- lots of the people can't play in "Would you rather ...":

> *Would you rather  work on something interesting and learn, or earn a lot" pick "Earn a lot"?*
> 
> *Would you rather do X or Y" pick whichever is safer?*

etc.

End these aren't bad answers. The problem is that most of answers I get are
"I don't know".  I see older people knowing what they want and actually
knowing what they wanted where they started to do engineering. It's pretty
depressing that these are the only people in big companies, who know what
they want. Yet, you have 0 chances to work with them.

Oh boy, oh boy. But interests are like women--you don't choose them, they
choose you.  And this will be something that might be problem no. 1 in my
life I guess.  Hardware companies aren't too fun to work for. At least
nowadays. At least big ones.  Really. But yet I'm interested in
software/hardware interfaces, and it's what hardware companies need
nowadays.

#### NCGs ####

![NCG](/img/pinky.jpg)

Problem is that "new college grad" in these companies get some grunge work from what
I see.
Hard to blame companies, since lots of "new grads" come with little skills
in anything, so limiting their responsibility is probably the way to avoid
disaster.
I'm no better either, though I know some Si Plus Plas as well as what NOT
gate does. Oh well, but anyway..

The problem of not being able to do "decent" stuff touches somebody, from what I see.

When a PhD on
my university told me his company is making LOTS of money by buying ready to
use components from the Delphi-module journal, putting them all together
with a glue, and selling, I really couldn't believe. I understood selling
products as building new stuff, from the ground. I considered ready-to-use
API interfaces fine, since it's impossible to write JPEG compressor from
scratch each time your write an image manipulation program, but buying whole
modules, with forms, and basing your products on it?

#### Duct tape ####

![duct tape](/img/ducttape.jpg)

But there's really freaking tight schedule to push stuff out of the door, so
there's just not enough time. I start to have a big respect to companies
which just hack random stuff in random ways, glue crap together, put nice
GUI around it and sell it for $$$. Not that I have a push toward delivering
crap because I don't, but I now have more respect to comments like:

>	how_many_reruns = 3;	// We rerun 3 times, since 2 isn't enough

3 years ago my thinking would be "Sh.t". Now it's: "Somebody really wanted
this software on time" or "Guy had 'can do' attitude".

Not always your project can encompass building LibSSL for your
secure communication. Or even RSA-based security.
Even building stupid FLViz - the visual simulator of finite-state machines
made me realize that building good software nowadays is all about APIs and
ready-to-use modules, since in order to get your FSM represented nicely,
with round circles and lines between them not crossing in an odd ways, you
have to have a ready-to-use library.
(BTW, Algorithms used in Graphviz are something people have been writing PhD
thesis on, so when my Professor said he would have written similar program in
Turbo Pascal, without any library, over duration of 2 days, I knew it's not
Turbo Pascal but FORTRAN he last must have touched)

#### Depressing trend continued ####

I somehow didn't see this problem with hardware. Hennessy&Patterson books,
the two most influential books I've read which made me run into serious
trouble, somehow didn't explain how building CPUs looks like nowadays.

But it's all about ready-to-use boxes, which people just glue together and
keep testing. To DEATH.

Partly, I believe, problem comes from size of nowadays products. I don't
know exact numbers for judging small, medium or big companies. Lockheed
Martin I've read the other day has 100,000 people. That's freaking big
number. Even if it's 100 teams with 1000 each, you must know 1000 people
it's a lot of man-months to do stuff. Yes, Brooks showed us it starts to be
problematic with more than 1 person already. So 100x1000 tells us something
about complexity of project/management.

(Don't cross your elbows on your stomach and don't laugh yet if you're from
Lockheed Martin. I mean every company from BigEvil5)

Chips company's from what I see are anything from 100 to ... choose BIG
number here people.

#### No hope ? ####

So where the hell do you find places like The Old Corps in the Valley nowadays?
Where new college graduates are exposed to this tactic of letting them do
something important and having them build something useful?

These old days were when CPU's ALU unit consisted several PCB
boards, wired together with some form of rope and a duct tape and God Lord
knows what else. I know, I know. Nowhere near 3.5nm technology costing trillions. I know
that. That's not important here.

But it looks to me that, largely, industry is all about integration of
elements other people did in the past, while these 'other people' remain
undefined, since this group is so small that it's hard to spot.

I could include some more examples from all the piles of used, historical
books ordered from Amazon for $0.01 each, but let me save you some time.

__They might be as valuable as $0.01 nowadays.__

What makes me sad is that building teams across experience levels seems uncommon. It doesn't surprise
me, since I'd have a hard time working with people who have never programmed
computer before I guess, and this is how I believe all these bearded guys can view
me, young Fawn.

#### Conclusion with no moral ####

![as](/img/royalty-free-preacher-clipart-illustration-1047845.jpg)

These stories from the old time, about young people doing something
valuable, I believe, are there just so that senior
guys who entered 21st century on their own legs can make laugh at us, silly
people, who started their computer career from Turbo Pascal on the PC
computer, with 8MB of RAM, while they, old gurus, Greek godheads, with
lightnings in their hands, were punching their algorithms with a screwdriver
on a paper towels and "Gosh, it worked SOOO well".

Or maybe places like that still exist?
