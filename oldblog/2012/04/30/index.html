<p>I was asked couple of times  to collect notes on productivity in *nix systems, so I
thought: "Why don't I create a post about it?". </p>

<p>This is a hard topic in general, since there's lots of lots of subjects
here. UNIX wasn't ever built as a easy to use system, but it's pretty damn
logical once you understand what it's all about.</p>

<p>So you're fortunate enough to have a pleasure to work on *nix system, huh?
It not necessarily has to be a pleasure -- you might want to pick this darn
UNIX system that you were forced to use for the very hot task you were
assigned to.</p>

<p>Anyway..</p>

<p>My work requires me to spend a lot of time on GNU/Linux based system and
perform a lot of stuff by typing commands.</p>

<p>Yes, I know, I know. You're Windows user and you think it's a waste of time.
Sometimes indeed it is. Simply speaking: for certain things graphical
programs will be much better. For some, however, you need a way to have very
quick technique of performing tasks in a batch mode.</p>

<p>Batch means: no need to sit and do monkey-alike tasks, but writing small
tool for performing these tasks for you. </p>

<p>This is possible in UNIX.</p>

<p>For the purpose of reference to myself and for the benefit of others, here
are 10 sets of commands that <em>you absolutely must know</em> if you're serious
about doing UNIX stuff on a daily basis.</p>

<p>If you're logged in on your system now, it's worth typing:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~
</code></pre>

<p>This will move you to your home directory.  Type:</p>

<pre><code>pwd
</code></pre>

<p>This should show you something line:</p>

<pre><code>/home/wkoszek
</code></pre>

<p>Or in general:</p>

<pre><code>/home/&lt;user_name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Depending how your system is configured.  I won't go in depth here, since
there's lots of more more concrete guides on shell commands, but anyway
here's general naming:</p>

<ul>
<li>Current directory:    <code>.</code></li>
<li>Upper directory   <code>..</code></li>
<li>You're home directory <code>~</code></li>
<li>Main system directory <code>/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code>cd .
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn't move you anywhere.</p>

<pre><code>cd ..
</code></pre>

<p>Moves you to the directory "above" the current directory, e.g.: if:</p>

<pre><code>pwd
</code></pre>

<p>Returned:</p>

<pre><code>/home/wkoszek
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>cd ..
</code></pre>

<p>Will move you to:</p>

<pre><code>/home
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>cd ..
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>/
</code></pre>

<p>Typing:</p>

<pre><code>cd /
</code></pre>

<p>Goes to the main system directory (you don't want that probably), and would
give you the same result, if typed from your home directory.</p>

<p>So you can get back:</p>

<pre><code>cd home
</code></pre>

<p>Typing:</p>

<pre><code>pwd
</code></pre>

<p>Now should show you:</p>

<pre><code>/home
</code></pre>

<p>And typing:</p>

<pre><code>cd wkoszek
</code></pre>

<p>Should give you</p>

<pre><code>/home/wkoszek
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you do:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~
</code></pre>

<p>now, the rest of the commands here should be save to execute. This will let
you practice a bit as you read.</p>

<h2>File descriptors</h2>

<p>This is a wide subject, but shortly speaking:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keyboard (so called: standard input, STDIN)</li>
<li>Screen for normal messages (standard output, STDOUT)</li>
<li>Screen for error messages (stadard error output, STDERR)</li>
</ol>

<p>Note for (1) and (2): I purposely say "screen" - either physical screen, or
your graphical session can be a screen. Think of: where my junk shows up.</p>

<p>(Yes, these are numbers: you'll be forced to remember them).</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Since UNIX works with a very simple concept in mind:</p>

<pre><code>read from standard input (0, STDIN)
write on standard output (1, STDOUT)
</code></pre>

<p>Since in UNIX every program tries to read from keyboard:</p>

<pre><code>cat -n
</code></pre>

<p>(type some stuff in couple of lines, hit CTRL+D when finished -- this is
already pretty useful sometimes, isn't it?). You'll see what I mean later.</p>

<p>So how not to make input be a keyboard? Use magic &lt; character:</p>

<pre><code>cat -n &lt; /etc/hosts
</code></pre>

<p>So suddenly, for <code>/etc/hosts</code> file, you get magically and for free ... line
numbers.</p>

<p>UNIX will always try to write to STDOUT:</p>

<pre><code>cat -n &lt; /etc/hosts
</code></pre>

<p>Will spit stuff on the screen for you. What if you want to save it? Use a
magic character > which redirects STDOUT to a file.</p>

<pre><code>cat -n &lt; /etc/hosts &gt; my_hosts_numbered
</code></pre>

<p>So in other words:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>&lt;</code> redirects STDIN and 'feeds' program on the left side with data on
the right side</p></li>
<li><p><code>&gt;</code> redirects STDOUT and will take data produced on the left side to the
file on the right side of the <code>&gt;</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now: sometimes you may want to pass data from 1st program to 2nd program.
This is accomplished by:</p>

<pre><code>cat /etc/hosts | wc -l
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>wc -l</code> counts lines passed to the program). So <code>|</code> simply speaking makes
2nd program use STDOUT of the 1st program as it's STDIN. This is called a
pipe. 1st program produces data, white the 2nd program eats its data.</p>

<p>Summary: The way I think is: data flows from left to right if you see <code>|</code>
(pipes), since every program on the left side is producing data for the next
neighbor of the right. Use this rule unless you see <code>&lt;&gt;</code> characters. If you
see <code>&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;</code> treat them as arrows pointing you a direction of a data flow
in the command.</p>

<h3>touch</h3>

<p>Creates empty file.</p>

<pre><code>touch empty
</code></pre>

<p>Will create empty.</p>

<h3>cat</h3>

<p>Will read the file.</p>

<pre><code>cat empty
</code></pre>

<p>Will show you file <code>empty</code>. Since it's empty, this shouldn't show you
anything. There's this thing that is called redirection of the output.</p>

<p>What <code>cat</code> really does it assumes you'll </p>

<h3>vim/emacs</h3>

<p>Mastering your editor is the biggest productivity improvement in my opinion.
It is interesting to see really experienced people using <code>gedit</code> or other
not-so-appropriate editors at work. For those unfamiliar: <code>gedit</code> on
GNU/Linux is like Notepad on Windows: you can't choose worse for typing
anything in that editor.</p>

<p>Editor on UNIX aren't the easiest thing to learn.</p>

<p>Yup. That's it. Such a basic thing as text editing is harder on UNIX. It's
because it's a known fact that more aggressive learning curve will
compensate your time in the boost of productivity.</p>

<p>I recommend <code>vim</code>. Others use <code>emacs</code>. They're basically the same, if
you spend long enough on learning them. Bear in mind: these are operating
systems with the side effect of text editing. Learn them if you have time.
If you don't, try something easier: <code>mcedit</code>, <code>pico</code>, <code>ee</code>.</p>

<p>Short example: making new file <code>new_file</code> in <code>vim</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>vim new_file
:
wq
</code></pre>

<p>Making <code>new_file2</code> with <code>I am a new file</code> text in it is:</p>

<pre><code>vim new_file2
i
I am a new file
&lt;ESC&gt;
:wq
</code></pre>

<p>OK, you get the feeling. It's worth to study. I might want to devote
separate post to it. For now it's enough.</p>

<h3>mkdir, cd, pwd</h3>

<p>These are very easy.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir my_new_directory
cd my_new_directory
pwd
</code></pre>

<p>Just try it. You won't break anything. So you get the feeling. To get back
to where you were, type:</p>

<pre><code>cd ..
</code></pre>

<p><code>..</code> means "directory in which I was before I typed <code>cd</code>".</p>

<h3>ls, find</h3>

<p>So lets make new directory <code>new_dir</code> and go there:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir new_dir
cd new_dir
</code></pre>

<p>Wanna see what's in it? Type:</p>

<pre><code>ls
</code></pre>

<p>Now, lets practice some more:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir 1 2 3
ls
</code></pre>

<p>Another excercise:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir 1/a 1/b 1/c
mkdir 2/double 2/two 2/2nd
</code></pre>

<p>To see them from where you are:</p>

<pre><code>ls -d */*
</code></pre>

<p><code>*</code> means "of whichever name". Basically if a commands that you're typing
"see" the <code>*</code>, they'll do "Hmm... Star? What the hell? I don't know precisely
what that means. I'll show all possible entries".</p>

<p>Command <code>ls</code> is kind of special. The more you spend on getting it to work
for you, be better for you. </p>

<p>You see I passed <code>-d</code> to <code>ls</code>. These are flags. Anything that starts
with <code>-</code> means "Stuff that isn't about directories or files, but about
hints to the program". So nearly all UNIX programs support some form of
<code>-&lt;whatever&gt;</code> that can sometimes modify how the program behave.</p>

<p><code>ls</code> has a lot of those, but to make you more productive, try:</p>

<pre><code>ls -a
ls -la
ls -lar
</code></pre>

<h3>tail, head</h3>

<p>Show last and first lines of a file:</p>

<pre><code>tail -10 &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>last lines of a file.</p>

<pre><code>head -10 &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Shows first 10 lines of a file.</p>

<h3>grep</h3>

<p>This is too broad to cover here I think. Try to do simple:</p>

<pre><code>cat /etc/hosts first
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>cat /etc/hosts | grep ^#
</code></pre>

<p>later. You'll see the difference.</p>

<h3>sort</h3>

<h3>xargs</h3>

<h3>wc</h3>

<h3>sed</h3>

<h3>awk</h3>
