<p>So it's a week after I reviewed 32 Google Summer of Code proposals for
FreeBSD.  If you don't know anything about it, try to see Google's Google
Summer of Code website.  Shortly speaking - it's a sponsored action letting
students spend their summer (8 weeks) hacking Open Source projects, learning
new stuff, helping community, growing as programmers and engineers and
additionally -- earning some additional money.</p>

<p>Organization gets $500 for accepted project. Students gets $500 for accepted
project. In the middle of the deadline (midterm) students get 50% of
expected compensation: $2500. The rest comes at the end.</p>

<p>Since this was my 1st GSOC as a mentor and administrator, I decided to give
my short summary what I think about GSoC:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's a very valuable program for young people, who otherwise would have
been unnoticed.</p></li>
<li><p>It's a good boost in the community. GSoC gave some more life in Open
Source, since even if not for the pure technical joy (at first), people
decide to hack stuff for fun and profit (in middle-eastern countries $5000
per 2 months of work is pretty damn good)</p></li>
<li><p>It's a good give back from Google, who tends to steal lots of valuable
people from the community. Young people bring some more fresh air into the
projects, and sometimes are valuable in terms of providing feedback to the
project from the point of view of newcomers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Due to the point no. 3 I feel FreeBSD Project should pick projects smartly.
Basically we don't want to strech generousity of Google too much. As I
mentioned before, students get $500 for the proposal acceptance. Thus, if
FreeBSD picks more projects, Google needs to spend more AND people from
FreeBSD community must spend more time on mentoring and coordination.</p>

<p>This is big responsibility and a lot of work.</p>

<p>So, yes, we all do agree Google is very rich. However, we don't want to accept
proposals which we know are not quite right. Don't get me wrong - it's not
proposals gets declined due to political reasons or our laziness. I do know
that some proposals for another Google event, Google Code-In, were very
good. But the amount of coordination that went into them required basically
overwhelmed the value they were bringing.</p>

<p>In Google Code-In, sometimes I also saw right away that attitude of the
participant wasn't great. We had cases of Linux users applying for FreeBSD
projects and working on FreeBSD still now knowing, that FreeBSD isn't Linux.</p>

<p>Google Summer of Code is different. This is more serious event, since you
have older people working on projects. People are older and smarter,
projects are bigger and prices are bigger too.</p>

<p>We expect more from you. You have a chance to work with really experienced
people, have fun and get some points in your resume, so please spend some
time on your proposal and ideas.</p>

<p>Do research on the topic.  Learn as much as possible before applying
(please, please, learn the basics of the project X; if you apply for project
X, use Google or Wikipedia and read page about X 10 times).  Look how
previous proposals looked like; compare your proposals with it.  Figure out
what people from previous years of GSoC did. Is their work available? Do you
want to work on stuff other people started, but didn't finish? Look what
other people do nowadays. Is your project aligned with their work? Is there
an overlap? What's the interest in your project?  Do other people are
willing to review your work? Do you have competition?</p>

<p>These questions seem easy, but they might be a key for understnading: (a) if
you really want to work on your project (b) will you find an interest in
your project (c) will you be able to find a mentor (d) will the work be
useful after you finish it.</p>

<p>So don't get me wrong - if I had submitted the proposal it wouldn't have been
perfect either. However, I think I'd more or less know the field. So once
again: mistakes are fine, but if you didn't analyze the case deep enough, it
may turn out your proposal will be declined.</p>

<p>I think the reason people submit bad proposals is because they think
acceptance is like 90% of success. Indeed, it's success, but it's not like
90% success. Let make it 10% success. Or 5%.</p>

<p>But remember that working on the project is just like a normal job: you have
assumptions, you have requirements imposed by your proposal, you have some
hints, but lots of work you must do by yourself.</p>
