<p>I sometimes walk around Menlo Park and Palo Alto.  No particular purpose.
No target.  I'm the fortunate one who treats walking as an entertaining
activity, which is a leftover from my childhood.  I always walked a
lot--starting from my primary school, where my family was picking me up (you
see, in Poland protective parents/grandparents don't ever imagine young
children getting back home by themselves) through junior-high school (where
I was allowed to travel around the city) to high-school, where I started to
treat walking as a form of meditation. Most of ideas about computers and
programming, as well as solutions to problems, I get while walking.</p>

<p>I think I'm just a fresh air addict.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm comparing all these places which I've visited and where I've had
a chance to look around, and I must say Bay Area is quite unique.
Social differences in Bay Area are really extreme.
Not only difference between rich/poor, but in general: social differences.
I'm sometimes amazed about what I experience around.</p>

<h3>So... or 101 on getting your way on University Ave</h3>

<p>University Ave, want it or not, is the center of Silicon Valley. Without
arguing where Shockey worked most often (theory of Mountain View being 1st
center of Silicon Valley) I think connection to Stanford makes Palo Alto >
Mountain View. </p>

<p>Some things which I've experienced...</p>

<h3>People playing instruments are probably in hi-tech or science and research</h3>

<p>About a year ago I've heard good section of trumpet and decided to follow
the sound of music in a hope sound of an acoustic drum kit will  appear. I
saw a gentleman dressed in a suit of old European nobility playing trumpet.
After short discussion about music and jazz, I started to get a lesson about
scales and consonances and waves, and vibrations. And harmonic functions.
And so on. Generally the knowledge par beyond what typical trumpet player
would have. Asked, gentleman replied he's a astrophysicist, artist,
unemployed; with main source of income coming from posing to a nude photos
in an art school, somewhere in Bay Area. Pretty interesting.</p>

<h3>Be careful how you're talking to people</h3>

<p>I put emphasis on "people", since I literally mean everybody. Interesting
thing is that homeless people in Palo Alto show up in Menlo Park McDonald's,
dressed much better than in Palo Alto, and have intelligent discussion with
each other on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>They are exceptional</h3>

<p>Somebody asks you for $0.25 for a pizza in front of <a href="http://pizzamyheart.com/Pizza_My_Heart_Locations.html#PaloAlto">Pizza My
Heart</a> and
you refuse. 15 minutes later you guys sit next to each other and you start
the conversation about this strange little fishes he adds to his pizza. And
through the way person talks to you you already know the person is, very
well educated, smart, homeless by choice and even though leads poor
lifestyle, has a very rich life</p>

<h3>When talking to people, expect 90% of time you're more stupid then they are</h3>

<p>Basically it looks like Palo Alto and Menlo Park are large gatherings
of super-smart cloud of IQ. Yes, sometimes I talk to somebody who does Ph.D
at Stanford and I'm not too impressed by the person habits and behavior (or
even knowledge), but people like that pretty much always hold something
special in their sleeve.</p>

<h3>Don't tell people about your 20-year old car</h3>

<p>From what I see people expect me to have brand new car (especially leased.
Because leasing is good, they say.)</p>

<p>"Wojciech, now that you got a full-time job, you're on your way to buying
new car".</p>

<p>Yy... No, thanks.</p>

<h3>It's possible to meet Prof. Knuth</h3>

<p>I asked if it's him. He nodded. We shook hands, but he seemed in rush, so I
so: "Thanks for the books" and he left. Really lifetime changing experience
:)</p>
