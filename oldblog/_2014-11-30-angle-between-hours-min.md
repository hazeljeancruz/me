In cracking the coding interview, one of questions mentioned in the
introduction of a book is to measure the angle between the hour and a minute

XX pointer?
XX clock's table?

The calculations derived in a book were made fairly difficult. Too much in
my opinion. Yet final result also seemed to not be fully correct.
