### NOTES ###

Effective negotiating is something I felt would be worthwhile to study,
since the whole subject was relatively new to me.

Once you first meet the US car salesman you just KNOW negotiating is
something you must improve.

Letting other person go first is probably the most essential thing derived
from this book. Very helpful in salary negotiations.

Getting to win-win is Covey's passage which is also forwarded to the reader
in this thing.

Partnerships are discussed and the idea of not directing negotiations
towards win/loose, but "mutual win" with long term benefits.

I'd qualify this position to a must for a day-to-day business operation.
