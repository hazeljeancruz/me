### NOTES ###

The title of a book is probably to boost sales a little, yet I fell is that
"Office survival guide" would be a better title for this position.

This book is basically for people who haven't read XKCD or Dilbert. If
you've read those, you know how difficult it sometimes is to get things
organized in the office. But if you haven't, I suggest you pick this one.
It's a nice little book summarizing the procedures for getting your work
done in a corporate setting.
